INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
The mysteries of ages past await you in the Fabula Ultima Natural Fantasy Atlas!
This expansion to the Core Rulebook focuses on a genre mainly defined by truly
ancient secrets, vast uncontaminated territories, heroes who are both humble and
persistent, antagonists driven by unbridled curiosity (as well as by their fear of death
and the unknown) and powerful manifestations of elemental forces.
This Atlas differs slightly from the Core Rulebook and the previous Atlases because
its stories are usually far more delicate and less bombastic, but no less heroic – on the
contrary, it deliberately explores the fundamental concepts at the roots of conflict in
every other genre: community, harmony and coexistence.
Besides offering a brief introduction to the way we envision the natural fantasy genre,
this Atlas provides advice and game materials for the Game Master and additional
rules for Players, all in three simple chapters:
 The World provides valuable elements for creating natural fantasy settings, including
10 archetypal locations you can use as campaign elements or for inspiration, plus a
list of new rare items and artifacts inspired by folklore and tradition.
 The Protagonists introduces 4 new Classes (Floralist, Gourmet, Invoker and Merchant).
It also provides several optional rules (such as Camp Activities) to highlight moments
of rest and bonding between Player Characters in the group.
 The Antagonists chapter focuses on 5 Villains – pregenerated Bosses, each more
fearsome than the last – that embody the challenges and obstacles of this journey.
When compared to the genres of high fantasy and techno fantasy covered in previous
Atlases, Natural Fantasy is less frequently the focus of JRPG-style works, and this book
doesn’t presume to be a complete guide to it. Some sections are tied more closely than
others to their authors’ creative and philosophical inclinations: their goal is to provide
advice and examples from the inspirational works (see page 207), useful both to those
well-versed in this genre, and especially to those who have recently found their way to
Fabula Ultima and JRPGs in general.
Just turn the page to learn more!

WHAT DEFINES FABULA ULTIMA’S NATURAL FANTASY?
In this book, and in Fabula Ultima in general, the term “natural fantasy” indicates a
series of specific elements that the authors feel are characteristic of a particular way
of building stories and settings.
In brief, we are discussing the authors’ personal visions, which do not claim to be the
absolute truth. Indeed, narrative genres have nebulous boundaries, and it would be
impossible – maybe even irresponsible – to box them in too much.
What follows may help you to better understand the creative roots behind this book!
9 COMMON PEOPLE
The Player Characters in a natural fantasy campaign are usually everyday people,
albeit possessing some unusual abilities: the princes, archmages, dark knights and
sky pirates found in other genres give way to explorers, alchemists, scholars and
wandering warriors. These protagonists are often young and unaware of the great
mysteries of the world, with the exception of a few fragmented legends which have
scores of different interpretations. The focal points of the natural fantasy style are
rediscovery, understanding, empathy, respect, and love for the world we live in and are
part of, as well as for its past. Looking for answers with curiosity and humility we will
come to harmoniously coexist with ourselves as well as the world at large.
9 THE MENTOR
In spite of what we just said, it is possible to play as a Player Character who “knows
a lot”, but in natural fantasy these kinds of characters have two key traits: first, they
hesitate to share their wisdom, often revealing crucial information only when they
find it absolutely crucial (an excellent way to spend Fabula Points); second, they
aren’t able to solve the world’s problems without the rest of the group. A classic
example is an old scholar who discovered an ancient power which might be able
to protect the region… but also that said power is exclusive to a certain bloodline
which they aren’t a part of.
Of course, the role of mentor should be limited to one character per group, usually
the oldest. More often than not, this protagonist will end up having to reconsider how
much they really know and may even face a personal crisis, eventually finding the
answers they need in their younger companions.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER
“Before deciding how to face this calamity,
you should understand what created it.”
9 VERTICAL DEVELOPMENT
Natural fantasy campaigns are often set in small regions or villages rather than entire
continents and cities, but compensate for this “limited perspective” with vertical
development: the current world was built upon countless layers of history, where
terrible powers and wondrous magics are buried. These are truly ancient worlds,
where the past is millennia away rather than centuries, so that the causes of today’s
misfortunes are often incomprehensible.
9 LIFE, DEATH, AND TRANSFORMATION
Natural fantasy mostly does away with epic and spectacular aesthetics, instead
presenting Fabula Ultima’s thematic core in a visceral and sincere way, and involving
the protagonists on an intimate and personal level: these are stories about the
environment, life, and death. Like fairy tales, and the philosophies and traditions that
inspired it, the natural fantasy style presents death as a necessary step for the world
to regenerate – a terrible pain and yet an opportunity to appreciate life; a meaningful
act which cannot be inflicted lightly, nor be stripped of its solemnity.
9 MAIN REFERENCES
Here are some titles that shaped the artistic vision of this book:
 The Dusk trilogy (Ayesha, Escha & Logy, Shallie) from the Atelier series is without a
doubt one of our main influences. It’s set on a dying world victim of the manipulations
of ancient humans, a world that can only be revived thanks to the tenacity of a
younger generation. The Ryza trilogy and the Sophie duology also influenced the
aesthetics of this book.
 The Monster Hunter Stories series shares its setting with the famous Monster Hunter
saga, but emphasizes cooperation between human and monster and the importance
of preserving even the most dangerous species.
 Jade Cocoon: Story of the Tamamayu is a great example of a campaign that takes
place in a short time frame, and is set in a relatively small place: a single village and
the surrounding forests struggling against a terrible curse.
 Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl features a truly inspired cast of
characters and a plot centered around the progressive discovery of the mysteries
of the past. It also reinvents the concept of a post-apocalyptic world as a lush and
verdant landscape.
8
W
On page 14, Fabula Ultima’s Core Rulebook discusses the Eight Pillars that uphold its
entire game experience. This Atlas builds on those elements in its own way.
ANCIENT RUINS AND HARSH LANDS
This pillar plays an important role in the natural fantasy style: its protagonists often
find themselves traversing vast uninhabited regions, where ground and roots merge
with millennia-old ruins of the past.
The wind blows strong among the cavities of the jungle trees. Rumor has it that, in the
past, a skilled navigator used the thermal updrafts to fly over the hunting grounds of
the dynaguars and reach the Shattered City.
The Orwie river’s spring is lost among the fog and the crevices of the Eastern Glacier.
Its many waterfalls run between the colossal remains of the Stone Guardians that,
according to legends, hold up the sky and prevent the stars from falling.
The narrow strip of land connecting the Sparrow Coast to the archipelago can be
crossed only at low tide, when the metal skeletons of the Airship Cemetery emerge
from the waters and the forebearers’ machines awaken.
A WORLD IN PERIL
In natural fantasy worlds, humanity is defined by its relationship to the creatures of
wilderness: some coexist with them, others hunt them for food or protection. Far
more dangerous are those creatures born of ancient curses and experiments, not to
mention any antagonists who want to make an improper or self-serving use of magic
and technology from the past.
Eager to gain the approval of the city and its Council, a young inventor decides to
unearth and reactivate an ancient alchemical machine, unaware that its magical
vibrations will once again lure the Calamity Serpent.
One baby out of seven is born with a red horn sprouting from its forehead, flowers
bloom without color, waters boil, and fire lashes out against those who attempt to
wield it. Oracles claim that the cinder giant, whose spirit was dismembered and
imprisoned in the temple of the Forbidden Valley so that humanity could tame fire
and build forges, is finally enacting their revenge.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER CLASHING COMMUNITIES
In natural fantasy campaigns, the clashes between different factions are often of a
much smaller scale: tensions between neighboring villages or clans, and fights between
humans and animals or spirits, or between opposing parties of the same people. In its
darkest forms, such conflicts erupt into violence, expropriation, or even genocide.
Newly arrived in the village and terrified by a spiked wildcat sighted by his caravan
during the journey, a nobleman has ordered the local hunters guild to exterminate
all predators in the region. When they refuse to kill any creature that hasn’t attacked
the settlement, the noble hires some mercenaries from the Citadel amidts the plains.
Only the Inara know the procedures required to activate the progenitors’ metal
artifacts, which lie scattered around the archipelago. Driven by greed, the sheriffs of
the capital infiltrate Inara settlements to extort information; one of these operations
led to a terrible massacre of the natives.
EVERYTHING HAS A SOUL
This pillar is both central and explicit in natural fantasy: the stream of souls manifests
as elemental entities, animals or plants, veritable holy symbols that embody the life
cycle of regeneration and transformation. The stream of souls is also among the main
victims of the Villains’ actions.
Hell-bent on reuniting the fragments of her wife’s soul, scattered across the spirit
world, the witch Ihimi bound her spirit to the Rain Tree. Two thousand years have
passed and the stream of souls has stagnated: echoes of the departed roam the earth,
clinging to the living and turning them into terrible monsters.
Just as the Progenitors cried their tears to create the ocean and gave their flesh to make
the earth, the inhabitants of the Glass Isles accept that the nocturnal messengers
devour the bodies of the departed and feast on the grief of the living, bringing both to
the afterlife as nourishment and consolation for the ancestral spirits.
The four ancient trees of the region, also known as Vei Arbru, host the elemental
essences of the seasons: each is kept safe by a guardian fairy that nurtures it both
when it’s in bloom and when it withers before being born again.
10
W
MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY
The juxtaposition of magic and technology is a powerful element of natural fantasy
stories. Both have a light and dark side: magic is tied to natural elements, but it can
also destabilize them, causing terrible catastrophes; technology – a reminder of the
wars and destruction of the past – can be recovered and adapted, but it comes with
the risk of repeating the same mistakes.
The Necropolis is a chasm spanning the size of an entire region, that goes down into
the depths of the earth. Inside, magical energy – usually too rarefied to sustain any
Ritual – can be used in full. Scholars call this phenomenon tomb radiation and it
becomes more powerful the deeper you go.
Powered by a triple alchemical vapor-furnace and armed with massive steel spikes,
automatic crossbows and mortars, the armored train crosses the vast forests of magical
trees. It’s the only true connection between the various settlements of the region.
HEROES OF MANY SIZES AND SHAPES
The natural fantasy genre focuses upon the difficult journey toward coexistence and
harmony; as such, the Player Characters represent a fundamental opportunity to show
how representatives of different people and cultures can learn from each other and, in
a spirit of mutual respect, fight for the future together.
Bomiri is a young moth-girl from Mangrove Village. After the death of her elderly
mentor, she fully devoted herself to studying herbalism and medicine, in an attempt
to find a cure for the disease that killed her.
When she was twelve years old, Lovisa got lost in the crevasses of the Mora glacier and
was almost devoured by a young nagadon who was trapped in a cave with her. Despite
being afraid, she gathered food for herself and the hatchling, later preventing the
rescuers from killing him. Now they are inseparable and they carry letters, medicines
and information across the entire valley.
Famous among Inner Sea nomads for his generous and slightly-too-exuberant
character, Yalsi the thief is wanted by the imperial navy for daring to rob a high
official: hidden amidst gold coins was a strange necklace, which looks awfully familiar
to the metallic heads buried among the hills of Yalsi’s native village.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER IT’S ALL ABOUT THE HEROES
Natural fantasy protagonists might not look as extraordinary as other heroes but,
in reality, they embody the deepest meaning of heroism: humility, respect for life,
looking for dialogue, choosing the hardest path, and fighting cruelty and ignorance
with fiery compassion. From this point of view, the world has a desperate need for
people like them.
When their village was destroyed by the hill clan during their hunt for miasma
beasts, an old witch and a young blacksmith joined forces with a deserter and a
wandering swordswoman in an attempt to outpace the army and prevent it from
claiming a stone stele that, according to the seidr tradition, gives access to the
power of the Triclopean God.
A mysterious and terrible virus, known as scarlet death, is infecting the predators of
the region, prompting them to viciously maul weaker creatures and attack settlements.
Catha, a rasna warrior-poet, believes the epidemic originated at the brink of the
continent in the dragon boneyards, where lay the remains of once-great creatures
exterminated by the Ancients.
MYSTERY, DISCOVERY AND GROWTH
Given its focus on stories about travel, exploration, and encounters between different
people or discoveries from the ancient past, mysteries and growth are two key
elements of natural fantasy. At the same time, this genre questions the consequences
of the application of knowledge, and how it can be used for both good and evil.
Having reached the mechanical ruin buried among the dunes, the heroes discover
that the great forest is part of an ancient project to cleanse the environment, started
by a people who died out millennia ago. Its keeper is an artificial intelligence, meant
to guide humanity in reconstruction, but turned cold and uncaring by loneliness.
Growing up in the tower-city of Ur, council inspector Kalia was soon met with the
corruption rampant among her colleagues, who took advantage of their positions to
extort money from villages in exchange for “protection”. Her principles will be harshly
tested throughout the campaign, culminating in a fight with her superior officer, Corax,
which will cause her to permanently do away with her badge and dedicate herself to
helping others without the need for a fake authority to back her up.
“This world is ancient and in no hurry.
It reserves its deepest and most sincere affection
for those who take time to understand and grow.”

W
The following pages discuss some crucial aspects of participating in a natural fantasy
campaign with Fabula Ultima.
A RAW BEAUTY
The natural fantasy style relies on a careful balance between moments of calm,
serenity and beauty, alternating with moments of raw and direct contact with the
inevitable facts of life. Neither of these aspects can be sacrificed: keeping only the first
means presenting a false and “sanitized” version of nature; keeping only the second
leads to self-indulging morbidity.
This doesn’t mean that you have to include explicit or particularly gory descriptions.
On the contrary, discussing how to handle scenes of violence and death is paramount,
especially when they involve people or animals (see Core Rulebook, page 147).
THE HUNT
Killing other living creatures to protect your community or provide resources is a
common theme of natural fantasy and should be handled with care.
 Never minimize. Be it that of an animal, a plant, a person, or a spirit, death is a
significant event that should be dignified. It should never be cold or systematic,
especially in a natural fantasy game, where it should have ecological, emotional or
spiritual consequences. As explained on page 86 of the Core Rulebook, there is no
obligation to kill an opponent reduced to 0 Hit Points. It is a choice.
 Never demonize. If necessity demands it and proper respect is shown for the
consequences, killing another creature to save lives, protect the ecosystem, or
transform their body into nourishment, tools or instruments is an integral part of the
cycle of life, not a violation.
EVERY LIFE MATTERS
Even when the world revolves around the cyclical return of every lifeform to the
stream of souls (one of the Eight Pillars of Fabula Ultima, as shown on page 9), one
should never downplay the value of life. While it’s true that life (as a form of energy)
lasts for eternity across countless incarnations, this life (the memories, personality, and
feelings of a specific individual) is unique and irreplaceable, and the moment it leaves
us should never not be seen as a tragedy.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER COEXISTENCE DOESN’T MEAN SELF-ERASURE
In some stories, ecological themes are handled quite superficially: humanity is depicted
as a parasite, technology as a source of corruption, and ancient lifestyles become
romanticized and stereotyped, often without a solid historical or anthropological base.
Although they provide fertile ground for Villains, such simplistic perspectives represent
a form of cowardly nihilism.
What natural fantasy proposes is, instead, to make a humble and brave choice:
our heroes must stop seeing themselves as masters or tormentors of nature, and
remember they are merely one of its many expressions, embracing the responsibilities
that arise from their ability to invent, create, and transform.
In short, we can coexist with the planet we live in precisely because we are humans,
rather than in spite of it.
CULTURAL INFLUENCES AND COLONIALISM
When we imagine a story centered around sharing and coexistence, we are often
influenced by existing cultures that consider those principles as the foundation of their
civilization, tradition, and philosophy. Historically, however, those same cultures have
been targeted by violent and repressive colonialist politics, their voices silenced even
in present day. Their characteristic cultural elements are often trivialized and reduced
to mere appearances, robbed of their significance and made to conform to consumer
logic, a surface representation that removes all introspective or revolutionary charge.
If you want to take inspiration from these cultures when you create new stories and
characters, please strive not to repeat that harmful rhetoric:
 Look for detailed and not instrumentalized sources which present information with
integrity and respect, without trivializing cultural complexities or reducing them to
stereotypes.
 If your setting includes tribal cultures, or cultures inspired by real-world native
populations, do not consign them to the role of enigmatic strangers, keepers of
riches, threats or victims in need of help: make them full-fledged protagonists,
avoiding recurring stereotypes like the mystic, the raider or the scout.
 Finally, make sure not to associate the search for harmony and spirituality with a
forcibly ascetic, passive or impractical lifestyle; on the same count, do not associate
it with a lack of interest in science and technology.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
THE WORLD
This chapter provides a bird’s eye view of Fabula Ultima’s approach to natural
fantasy worlds. Both Players and Game Masters are welcome to read it – it contains
valuable tools for both roles.
The chapter is constructed as follows:
NATURAL FANTASY LOCATIONS
This section helps you create natural fantasy regions, settlements and landmarks. It
also provides ten in-depth examples of natural fantasy locations, each detailed first
as a narrative archetype, and then as a collection of playable hooks.
CONFLICTS
This section explores the conflicts typical of natural fantasy, from both narrative and
rules perspectives.
MAGIC AND RITUALS
This section delves into the role of magic and supernatural entities in natural fantasy
worlds, and what they represent.
TECHNOLOGY
This section provides ideas on how to frame the role of technology and craftsmanship
in natural fantasy worlds, including new rules to create items from raw materials.
RARE ITEMS AND ARTIFACTS
The chapter’s last two sections focus on rare items and artifacts you might find in a
natural fantasy setting. As well as general advice, there are also a number of readyto-
use item lists.
16
W
NATURAL FANTASY LOCATIONS
During World Creation (see Core Rulebook, page 148) and play sessions, you will
often be called upon to introduce new regions, towns, or interesting locations. This
section contains advice and suggestions and discusses the mindset to adopt when
creating natural fantasy locations, and then provides ten examples you can use in your
campaigns or draw upon for inspiration.
ANCIENT ROOTS, FUTURE BRANCHES
The key element that sets natural fantasy locations apart is simple, but should never
be taken for granted – it’s the tension between a mostly forgotten past and an
unpredictable future, a maelstrom of visions of ruin and hope.
 Roots in the past. Ancient events and their influence on the present might manifest
in many different ways: from the complex religious traditions of a clan of hunters to
the whispering ruins buried among the dunes of the desert. Every place has many
stories to tell and lessons to teach those who explore it with an open mind, humility
and respect, accepting even its long silences.
 Branching toward the future. The future is unpredictable and not yet written: its
potential might take the shape of a precious resource, a new generation able to break
a millennia-old curse or even a small cub or hatchling, the last survivor of its kind.
To be narratively alive and inspired, a natural fantasy location should exist in the
present, the liminal space between these vague extremes – showing the signs of a
past not fully understood and holding in its hands a fragile future, which will blossom
only if it’s protected without smothering it. We might say that:
If a location does not offer significant revelations about the world’s past or the
traditions of its inhabitants, nor hides a potential that might bring joy or ruination,
depending on how those same people cultivate it, then you need to put a bit more
work into it.
However, remember that it is not just the Game Master who has the right and
responsibility to create, describe, and enrich locations and areas in interesting ways.
For instance, you can spend a Fabula Point to describe how your character hears a
feeble voice coming from the nearby spring, despite the local elders believing its
guardian spirit has long abandoned it – this is the kind of contribution that Players
should provide often during the course of the game.
W
17

2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
COMPLEX CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES
Natural fantasy settings often cover a much smaller area compared to others, usually
a single region or no more than two or three settlements. You might think that this
limits the variety of situations and cultural contexts during the campaign, but in reality
it’s an excellent opportunity to flesh them out and make them more complex, human
and multidimensional.
 Recurring characters. When playing in a limited setting, it’s very likely that the same
character will appear over and over again, even after many sessions. Give each one
a name and a face, learn to love them, showcase their merits and flaws, and do your
best to make them grow and evolve as much as the protagonists.
 Humanity. No matter if they live in an elven village in the heart of the forest, are
part of an ancient people in possession of extraordinary technologies, or inhabit an
underwater city of fishpeople, each and every individual has feelings, an interest in
unique forms of art and beauty, doubts, and curiosity, and behaves according to their
own personal morality. No community should be a monolithic stereotype where
everybody thinks in the same way.
We might say that natural fantasy replaces vastness with density: this style of narrative
likes to take time to showcase, for better or worse, all the facets of each character and
asks you, in a gentle but firm voice, not to draw hasty conclusions, but rather to love the
world in all its complicated, ephemeral, and magnificent vibrancy.
THE RECONSTRUCTION
Natural fantasy worlds have weathered many catastrophes – the ability to get back
up after a disaster, to reinvent and rebuild a world together with those who surround
us is a recurring theme, but it might take two opposite forms. This dualism is often
mirrored in the locations and their inhabitants:
 Hope and adaptability. Some people don’t just survive in this new world, but find ways
to gain strength and enthusiasm from it. They find new passion and emotion in an
environment that tests them but they still respect the needs of nature.
 Reactionary nostalgia. At the same time, there are those who see reconstruction as a
way to go back to the past, to dominate nature without taking into consideration how
the world has changed, and how the past they idolize has brought them close to ruin
once already. They chase an illusion that will cause untold damage.
18
W
VERTICAL WORLDS
Some natural fantasy campaigns are characterized by a vertical exploration of the
setting: the story often starts on the surface and develops underground, but the
opposite is also possible.
For example, the campaign might focus on the long descent into the depths of a
chasm containing a huge variety of ecosystems, or the gradual ascent of a world tree
so vast its branches host entire regions, lakes and colossal ruins.
For the sake of brevity, no matter if the story develops toward the top or the bottom,
from this point on this kind of setting is called “abyss”.
Although playing Fabula Ultima with an abyss setting isn’t much different from usual,
there are a few adjustments to consider during World Creation (see Core Rulebook,
page 148) and throughout the campaign.
 World Creation. The flowchart on page 149 of the Core Rulebook should be replaced
with that on the next page, designed specifically for this kind of campaign.
 Origins. The Player Characters’ birthplaces are almost never visited during this type
of campaign, but the Origin Trait can be invoked as usual.
 Antagonists. The main Villain is often an environmental antagonist (see page 174)
with a corrupting presence, but they might also be someone who exploited the
group’s curiosity to open the way toward the heart of the abyss and its treasures.
 Traveling the abyss. Journeys across a single stratum follow the normal rules (see
Core Rulebook, page 106), but moving between two adjacent strata requires some
kind of connection, like a tower, a flight of stairs, or a frozen waterfall. In addition
to the connections established during step 5 (see next page), your group might
introduce or discover new passages and shortcuts during the campaign.
 Safe zones. To ensure that the group has a chance to rest, buy and sell items, or be
rescued in the event of a total Surrender, make sure to periodically introduce safe
havens across the various strata of the abyss, or include “fast travel” options to and
from the main settlement (ancient elevators or portals are good options).

none has ever seen the bottom of? Or an endless tower that stretches past the
clouds? Has anyone given it a specific name?
1
OW Take the abyss sheet and put a starting settlement at its top or bottom, where
the game will begin. Each participant should contribute at least one of the
settlement’s NPCs or landmarks, for instance a well-stocked general store or a
librarian with an expertise in archaeology.

OW At the opposite end of the map sits the heart of the abyss, and the campaign’s
very goal. Choose what it is: a world-saving resource, the answer to a terrible
question, or an entity to be sealed before it’s too late?
3
OW Create the strata of the abyss: five areas that separate the starting settlement
from the heart. Give each one a name and roughly define its ecosystem, flora,
and fauna. Then add at least one connection between each pair of neighboring
strata (including the heart and the starting settlement).

of the settlement, and an enigma or mystery surrounding that stratum. What
kind of theories do the explorers have about it?

OW Create a threat for each stratum: an environmental danger, a curse, or a terrible
monster that every explorer has heard about. The most terrible threat lies in the
heart – you can can broadly discuss its nature right now, or decide to leave it for
later during the campaign.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRASTS
One of the most effective ways to create a memorable natural fantasy location is
to base the environment upon the contrast between two typically opposite natural
elements, such as air and earth or ice and fire.
Common examples include icy plains dotted with bubbling geysers and rocky
deserts swept by the wind, but you could also have oceanic depths inhabited by
electric creatures.
In a similar vein, the contrast between old and new, artificial construction and natural
regrowth, adds personality to a location and often provides clues about who lived here
in the past and how things have changed over time. The result should be a form of
dynamic balance, and can also elicit feelings of melancholy or wonder in the travelers.
For instance, a vast horizon of skeletal skyscrapers overgrown by vegetation and taken
over by the nests of gigantic feathery creatures; or an endless grassland where herds
of bovine calmly graze in the shadow of rusty, titanic war machines.
The goal of such a location isn’t purely visual – it represents a fragile environment
that is worth protecting and a precarious peace that has been achieved, certainly not
without pain, over the course of the centuries.
FLORA, FAUNA, CONSTRUCTS, AND ELEMENTALS
Partially continuing from the points above one of the best ways to make a location
look alive is to populate it with creatures whose appearance, behavior, and abilities
are strictly tied to their environment.
 Beasts, monsters, and plants. These creatures might prove more or less aggressive –
similar to the flora and fauna of our world, with just a few anomalies. Their behavior
varies based upon instinct and habits – they may prove formidable opponents.
 Constructs. Relics who outlived their creators, constructs often lack a true conscience,
acting according to pre-programmed routines. Even when aware and intelligent, they
often speak ancient and almost forgotten languages.
 Elementals. Spirits of nature, fey creatures, and guardian presences all fall into this
category. They are often peaceful or playful, but their deep, instinctive attunement
with the stream of souls might easily lead to corruption.

USING THE SAMPLE LOCATIONS
The following pages contain ten complete natural fantasy locations, which you can
draw ideas from or place directly in your campaign, both during and after World
Creation – for example, when traversing an unexplored map region.
Each location entry is structured as follows:
 At a glance. This box provides a synopsis of the location: its keywords, the themes it
symbolizes, the terrain around it, and its elemental forces, as well as suggestions for
dangers and discoveries in the area.
 Questions for the group. In Fabula Ultima, you should not introduce elements
disconnected from the group. These questions give depth to the location and allow
Players to have creative input. Usually, the Game Master will ask the questions – and
they should make it a habit of doing so even when introducing locations that do not
come from an Atlas.
 Typical features. This section provides examples of characters and other elements
that can typically be found in this sort of location. Feel free to take these and use
them in other similar locations of your own devising.
 Position. Here, you will find suggestions on where to place this type of location, both
geographically and in the campaign’s timeline – towards a campaign’s start or end,
for instance.
 The Villains’ plans. This section provides suggestions on why Villains might be
interested in this or other similar locations.
 Story hooks. Lastly, this rich section details points of interest ($), mysteries (b) and
help requests (?), which the Game Master can use in whole or in part during play.
Players and Game Masters alike are welcome to read these sample locations – they
will help the group attune to the natural fantasy style, and can provide you with
inspiration when needed.
Do not take any of what follows as “canon” or “official”. You have full authority to modify
any of these places as you see fit!
“Change is the only true constant of life. Clinging to
the past for fear of the present is just a slow death.”

Few truly know what lurks behind the quiet of this enigmatic place lost in the depths
of the forest: the locals never cross its threshold – even during celebrations – and the
youngsters show great respect to those who dare enter just the first chamber. Moss
and lichens cover the wall of the now forgotten Badger Temple… and its secret should
be forgotten as well.
BADGER TEMPLE AT A GLANCE
Keywords: curse, trial, seal.
Terrain: stone, vines, water. Common elements: l a E

Dangers: a huge sentient plant guarding the path, a magical mist that fools the
senses, a barrier created by the statues that flank the entrance.
Discoveries: a spirit protector of the forest, a plant with miraculous properties,
a shrine hiding a prodigious blessing.
Themes: facing one’s fears, gaining self-awareness and selfconfidence,
understanding the past to build the future.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
9 TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Ancient Shrine should include at least one of these features:
 Creatures or spells to test those who enter.
 An incredibly ancient evil sealed inside.
 An artifact that belonged to a hero of the past.
 A legendary beast of great wisdom.
9 POSITION
Frequently enough, the location of the Ancient Shrine is already known at the
beginning of the campaign, but Player Characters might not be able to explore it in
full and be forced to return later with an artifact or a magic password. The Ancient
Shrine might be where the prologue is set, when the protagonists – unaware of the
original purpose of the structure and the unfortunate consequences of their curiosity
– discover or awaken something truly ancient and dangerous.
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Sometimes, the Ancient Shrine hides an artifact that a Villain wants but, for some
reason, can’t reach. These Villains often wait for Player Characters to overcome the
dangers of the Shrine, only to then waylay them. Otherwise, a major or supreme Villain
might be sealed inside, patiently waiting.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 A number of wooden statues dot the path to the temple.
What do they represent? Why are they here?
 A number of frescoes decorate the temple walls,
depicting an event so ancient it has been lost to time. What is it?
 The entrance to the temple is easy to find but the inner sanctum is well
protected. How do you access it? What prevents you from reaching it?
 The Badger Temple hides an incredible secret. What is it?
Who knows about it and what is its price?
 A terrible curse awaits those who desecrate the heart of
the temple. What are its effects, and can you break it?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Badger Temple into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich
the story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ HALL OF TRIALS
This narrow hallway winds across the depths of the temple, testing all who dare to enter.
 Light and darkness. A single torch shines true, revealing the living frescoes upon
the walls – the shadows of four badgers, each bearing a small rattle, slide among
the paintings. To continue, the PCs must collect the four rattles. Every time they roll a
Check to try, the GM fills 1 section of an 8 section Clock. If the Clock is filled before
they succeed, or if they attempt to use violence, a fearsome guardian emerges from
the frescoes. What is it? Which of the PCs knows legends about its weak spot?
 Hall of despair. This empty room seems endless. Every now and then, the pale image
of a badger appears, beckoning the heroes to follow them in the darkness. The PCs
have to fill a 6 section Clock to keep the spirit in sight and reach the exit. Whenever a
PC fails a Check, frustration gets the better of them, causing them to suffer a random
status effect among dazed, shaken, slow and weak.
 The door. The badger stops next to a great stone door covered in thorny vines, which
can be removed either with a Ritual or by suffering a heavy loss of Hit Points. The
badger glows with a feeble light, which restores all the PCs’ Mind Points.
 Dark vines. Sprawling creepers and living vines fill the entire room. At the center,
a massive, garish flower tinges the scene with scarlet and purple hues. A glowing
bud dangles from one of the vines, right above the jaws of the plant-creature at
the heart of the flower: its name is Rafflesia. Its stalk is covered in thorns, and
the badger-spirits are trapped in its two creeping tentacles. It’s Vulnerable to fire
damage, Resistant to ice and bolt, and Absorbs light, thanks to the glowing bud,
which also hypnotizes its targets, forcing them to attack the main body – those
who charge into melee are punished by its thorns. If both tentacles are defeated,
the twin badger spirits regain their powers and Rafflesia becomes Vulnerable to
light damage. How did this creature evolve? How was it created? What is hidden
at the center of the room?

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
b THE SNAKE-SPIRIT
A demon of ruin lies sealed in the heart of the temple and an almost forgotten
prophecy foretells that a descendant of the “snake lineage” will one day be able to
free it. What is known about this lineage? Who among the Player Characters has heard
of it? Or, who among them will discover that they descend from it?
 The treasure in the statue. In the bowels of the temple, wedged between the scales
of a giant stone serpent, there is an ancient scepter, the Soulthorn, an artifact capable
of imprisoning a soul. Only the chosen one can awaken its true power and free the
snake-spirit. What would be the consequences of its use? If left to its own devices,
what is the snake-spirit going to do once freed?
 An ancient pact. Although remembered as an evil being, the spirit actually taught
humanity the arts of herbalism, medicine, and poison. However, their gifts were used
to cause death and suffering and, to atone, the spirit began devouring any pain and
diseases they saw as born of their actions. As a last act, before corruption overcame
them, they sealed themselves away in the temple, and slowly lost all their memories.
 Recovered memories. By using the Soulthorn or coming into contact with the snakespirit’s
power, Player Characters may recover some fragments of their memory and
investigate further. What catastrophic event forced the spirit to cut all ties with the
world? Which of their memories might restore their confidence?
? ZECAR
An aristocratic fox-man called Zecar offers the Player Characters a lavish reward,
provided they help him recover a family heirloom from the temple.
 The sword of ages. Laying on a stone altar, this sword is an artifact that, according
to legend, grants luck, fame and wealth – but it’s protected by a seal. Who among the
Player Characters knows how to break it?
 Unmasked! Zecar’s ancestry gained its nobility thanks to the sword, but his ancestors
returned it to the temple, believing it was its rightful place. Once the blade is in his
hands, the haughty fox-man turns out to be a minor Villain and uses an Ultima Point
to escape. What are his intentions? Why was the sword returned? Which dark powers
does it hide and why is Zecar underestimating its influence?
“A dark omen awaits, trapped in the depths.
A pure heart will free it; a pure heart might defeat it.”

Many people stumble almost by accident into this small hamlet. Breezeburg is located
among the hills, far from the capital, the trade routes, and the rest of the world. On the
surface, it’s an idyllic place, almost drowsy, that makes good use of its few resources
– the inhabitants have learned how to respect the pace of nature and wind, living in
symbiosis with what they have to offer.
BREEZEBURG AT A GLANCE
Keywords: community, quiet, wind.
Terrain: hills, grasslands, brooks. Common elements: a l E
Travel roll: d8. Rare elements: b f a
Dangers: a foreboding presence living in the nearby forest, a swarm of crabby
insects, a great thunderstorm incoming.
Discoveries: a hermit who retired here to hide an important secret, an old
ruined building lost in the untouched wilds.
Themes: a simple life isn’t an easy one, blissful ignorance, false
security.
THE SLEEPY HAMLET
Breezeburg
27
W

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
9 TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Sleepy Hamlet should include at least one of these features:
 A gentle, soothing landscape.
 An eager population, although unaware of the outside world.
 A wise person of few words.
 A small shrine tied to a forgotten legend.
9 POSITION
The Sleepy Hamlet is a starting location par excellence – it could even be the
birthplace of one or all protagonists (perhaps with the exception of one of them, an
outsider whose sudden arrival puts events into motion). Our heroes might expect a
happy welcome, unless some negative event undermines the locals’ trust. Even then,
it should be possible to rebuild it.
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
A place like Breezeburg is rarely relevant in the antagonists’ plans, unless they were
born and raised there. Perhaps they were childhood friends of the eldest among Player
Characters. More often, an antagonist might be looking for an item or a person that
lives here, or the Hamlet might suffer collateral damage in the wake of the Villain’s
plan or the catastrophe they unleashed.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Breezeburg is isolated, but not forgotten – there is just nothing too
remarkable here. Is it really such a happy place? What is about to change?
 Creatures that couldn’t live anywhere else proliferate here,
thanks to the untouched wilderness. What makes them unique?
 The villagers live in harmony with the land, the flora, the fauna,
and every other natural element. Where does this tradition come from?
 A gentle breeze keeps the windmill’s blades in constant motion.
What traditions stem from this unusual situation?
 Although welcoming, the locals are very narrow-minded
and suspicious about innovations. Why?
28
W
W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Breezeburg into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich
the story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ HIGHILL ROAD
The highest part of Breezeburg is dominated by the largest windmill and the most
important buildings in the settlement all lie just along the road.
 The windmills. These massive structures work without pause; their huge blades spin
constantly in the wind. Both as part of the irrigation system and by powering the
millstones, they contribute to the survival of the small hamlet, but not all seem to
serve the same purpose. What is the goal of these other windmills?
 The blacksmith. The small forge is the abode of a man tempered by his work and
proud of it. The firelight makes his creations shine: tools for farming, for common
use, and for artisans. There are no weapons, except an old sword hanging on the wall.
What is the story behind it?
 The inn. A modest inn stands along the road. The sign, creaking in the breeze, says
“The Wind Strider”. The building is rather small, but warm and cozy. It’s quite rare
for anyone to stop here: there are usually just one or two adventurers who came
by accident and are looking for some respite. Recently, though, a large group slept
here – they looked like acolytes on a pilgrimage. Who were they? Why did they stop
here of all places?
 The temple. Near the end of a forgotten track, at the highest spot in Breezeburg,
there is a small, old temple, covered in moss. It has long-since been abandoned, yet
a feeble heart pulses inside. If a Player Character gets close, a gentle, whisper-like
breeze blows. Arcanists, Chimerists, Invokers and Spiritists are the best suited to
interact. Who lives in this temple? Why was it abandoned?
b WHISPERING MANOR
The mansion house belonging to Breezeburg’s only noble family is the most ancient
building in the entire hamlet. According to the villagers, Whispering Manor has existed
since the settlement’s foundation. The building has three floors, rather distinctive
sloping roofs, and a large balcony, visible from the whole of Breezeburg. But the most
curious element is the great windmill on the roof, whose blades never move.
29

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Demetria. This young woman, the daughter of the last laird of Breezeburg, is secretly
a minor Villain. After the death of her father, she secluded herself in the manor in
isolation. Nobody knows why and the villagers bear no ill toward her, but this doesn’t
stop them from asking questions and spreading rumors. If the PCs manage to meet
her, Demetria is grumpy but not overtly hostile. She doesn’t talk about her decision
and asks them to leave the manor, using violence only if necessary.
 A dark secret. A long time ago, Demetria’s family captured Zephyr, the spirit of air,
to gain the wind’s favor and found the hamlet. Demetria is ashamed, but considers
Zephyr’s captivity a necessary evil for the sake of the community. She thinks she
deserves no love from the villagers and, in her bitter isolation, fails to notice that
the spirit themselves have nurtured resentment. Over the centuries they have
accumulated the power of all winds blowing across Breezeburg… and soon they will
wipe the hamlet out.
? A MISSING FRIEND
Mya, a child that lives in the hamlet, has lost her cat, Ruby. They usually played near
the edge of the forest and Mya is afraid that Ruby got lost within it.
 Ruby. A young, snow-furred and strangely silent cat, which Mya stumbled upon in
spring. They became inseparable, so the girl decided to adopt the cat and take care of
her, despite the other animals treating her with suspicion.
 Fang. Fang is a massive feline beast that lives in the woods near Breezeburg. The
inhabitants hate hunting and the local animals are peaceful, but recently Fang has
become extremely irritable. He owes the name to the massive fang poking out from
the left side of his jaw. He’s a skilled hunter, who can inflict slow with his powerful
claws and summon allies with a roar.
 A broken family. Fang is a loving father, but lost his dearest cub during the last harsh
winter. Ruby is actually the child of the powerful feline, reborn as a cait sith (see Core
Rulebook, page 342). In the heart of the forest, the heroes may witness a tender
moment as father and daughter are finally reunited. If the group tries to get back
Ruby, Fang will give them no quarter. The outcome of the scene rests on the Player
Characters’ decisions and, perhaps, Ruby’s intervention. Does she have any memories
of her previous life? Is one of the PCs, possibly a Chimerist, able to communicate with
her? How will Mya react to this situation?
“This isn’t a land of warriors and conquerors.
We breathe the wind and live in harmony
and with patience, following the old tradition.”

A haunted isle of steep inlets and rocky cliffs, Candle Bay is home to countless mysteries
and legends. The island owes its name to flocks of ominous will-o-wisps that light up
its nights, creating a somber and enigmatic atmosphere. Strange rumours abound of
this grim and equally fascinating landscape, but even an unsettling children’s tale can
conceal glimmers of truth...
CANDLE BAY AT A GLANCE

Dangers: a wrathful ghost that can’t find a way back, a small abandoned temple
infested with trickster spirits.

resources.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
9 TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Haunted Island should include at least one of these features:
 An ancient cemetery or ruin haunted by ghosts.
 A small port or other settlement facing some sort of struggle.
 A cruel specter, whose name appears in many horror stories.
 A direct link with the stream of souls.
9 POSITION
A Haunted Island might be part of the setting from the start, perhaps as a mystery
and/or threat, or the group might land on its shores because of a danger or as a result
of a Surrender. It’s usually the stage for an interlude or intermission, and as such
can be used at any point in the campaign. More rarely, it could be the heroes’ final
destination, especially if a powerful, corrupt creature made it their lair.
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
In many cases, a location like Candle Bay acts as a subplot in and of itself and has its
own local Villain (probably a minor Villain), although in some campaigns it might
assume a more central role – an antagonist might attempt to harvest the energy
of the restless spirits, or could even be a ghost themselves; or a terrible demon or
monster might consume the dark energies of the island to enact a metamorphosis
and reach their full potential.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Colored lights brighten the sky over the bay during “the night of lamentation”.
What characterizes this event?
 Since time immemorial, a majestic arc has dominated the great hill.
Why was it built? What are the rumors about it?
 It looks like the bay is the home of a creature that can grant wishes.
What is their true nature? What is the price of such a miracle?
 They say the island stands at a crossroad between the world of the living and the
world of the dead. What is its nature? Who would you like to see once again?
 The spirit of a famous character of the past manifests on certain nights.
Who are they? What do they have in common with one of you?
32

W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Candle Bay into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ MINING VILLAGE
Rich in copper veins, but inexplicably abandoned, the island has become the
destination for miners from all over the region.
 The dock. The bay’s cramped inlet presents the only possible dock for boats and
small ships. During the night, however, the ground shakes and restless ghosts pour
across the streets, imploring the miners to leave the island.
 The dig site. The miners’ countenances, marked by constant toil, betray their growing
concerns, but Baron Darius (minor Villain) feverishly pushes them to keep mining
copper. What does he crave (or fear) even more than the ghosts? Who among the
miners is a familiar face for the PCs?
 The Baron. Descended from a local noble family, Darius the Boastful craves fame
and power. Driven by a desire to emulate the deeds of his ancestors (or fearing to let
his lineage down), he strong-armed the population into working without pause, to
challenge and defeat the specter haunting Candle Bay.
 The Centipede. Made sluggish by the magical purifying properties of copper veins
present in the rock, a gigantic monster with almost impenetrable hide has slept
under the island for centuries. When challenged, they unleash seismic magic; their
carapace regenerates each round and they can also separate parts of their body,
which act autonomously in the form of soldier-rank enemies.
b THE SEVEN-TAILS’ FOREST
At the top of the hill, an ancient cemetery hosts the souls of the departed. At its center
stands a great cherry tree, apparently weak and dying. A dark aura seeps from the earth
and small will-o-wisps dance among the tombs, under the light of distant stars.
 Natsuki. In ancient times, the fox-demon Natsuki haunted the island. Attempts at
fighting them all proved futile, until they fell in love with the young Soh and swore
never to harm another human as long as he remained at their side. Determined to
save his people, Soh bravely accepted this bond – his spirit still roams the forest, now
only a pale blue flame. Did he regret his decision?
33
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 The cemetery. Other spirits haunt the weathered tombstones. None remember who
they were in life, and the inscriptions are almost unreadable. The PCs may spend
some time deciphering them and discover the secret of the cemetery: the people
of the island built it as a ritual site which sends a portion of the departed’s spiritual
energy to Soh’s soul, so that he would continue in his duty even after death. However,
the young man’s spirit is growing weaker. Why?
 The awakening. If the bond between Soh and Natsuki is broken, the demon returns
to torment the bay. The Game Master should create an “Awakening of the Seven-Tails”
Clock with 8 sections, filling one at the end of each scene, or each round during a
conflict with Natsuki. Each section except the last one represents the demon growing
a new tail, and once the Clock is full, Natsuki becomes a major Villain. In battle,
Natsuki can charm their opponents, inflicting dazed and weak; those affected deal
half damage to the demon. Natsuki is Vulnerable to air and light damage, Resistant
to earth and lightning and can Absorb dark.
? DIANA
The Player Characters find a bottle abandoned on the beach, containing a love letter. The
addressee appears soon: Diana, the ghost of the reef, tells the heroes her story and asks
for their help to reach a nearby atoll.
 Stormy sea. For getting too close to the human world, the nymph Talassia was imprisoned
inside the coral reef – and that’s how Diana eventually met her. She promised to come
back and visit her every day, but an unexpected storm took the life of the young woman,
who remained stuck in the bay as a ghost, unable to fulfill her promise. Diana wants to
see Talassia again, but spirits cannot cross the sea. How can our heroes help her?
 The sea nymph. A member of the sea people, Talassia has lived in the bay since time
immemorial, but ancient and strict laws forbid the nymphs from interacting with
surface dwellers, upon penalty of being sent straight back to the stream of souls.
 A happy ending? Eventually, lacking any news of Diana, Talassia tried to contact her
with the message in a bottle. If they are reunited, Talassia leaves the sea, stepping
onto land and returning to the stream of souls together with her dearest Diana: the
Player Characters can witness their last smiles… or perhaps the first of many. If they
wish to, they can add a special Bond to the two lovers to their sheets – this doesn’t
count towards the normal limit of six.
“The waters of the bay show the reflection of two worlds;
so close, yet so far apart. Reality doesn’t care if they are
benevolent or malevolent. They will return.”

9 TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Eternal Forest should include at least one of these features:
 Crystal-clear rivers forming majestic waterfalls.
 The remains of ancient paths, barely usable.
 Tunnels leading to enigmatic underground structures.
 A legendary animal of great wisdom.
9 POSITION
Usually, the Eternal Forest occupies most of the map of the known lands: all who
travel the continent have to cross it or sail its rivers. The Player Characters are likely
to spend a lot of time in the shadow of its trees, exploring many different areas and
stumbling upon dangers and discoveries that will change and evolve the forest
over the course of the campaign. Who knows… maybe one day they might even
reach those secrets hidden far below its roots!
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
The sheer size of the Eternal Forest makes it an ideal hideout for a Villain, who might
also take advantage of it and ambush the heroes. Also, some antagonists will be
interested in the treasures and the miraculous machines hidden in the depths of the
forest – some out of greed, and some hoping to wield their powers for good, unaware
of their collateral effects.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Navigating and surviving seem impossible, but the forest people live
in complete symbiosis with nature. What is their secret?
 The locals don’t trust strangers. What do they fear?
How can you gain acceptance from them?
 This place hosts a species considered extinct.
What kind of creatures are they? What makes them special?
 A plant with miraculous properties grows only here.
What are these properties? Who is looking for it, and why?
 Among the overgrown trees and shrubs, you find the remains of
a mysterious creature. Is it possible that their kin are still alive?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Cerulean Jungle into play, the GM may use the following points to
enrich the story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE COURT OF SEASONS
A colossal tree rises at the foot of a majestic waterfall. Its trunk splits into four sections,
each with different colored leaves, matching the season that rules it.
 The Spring Court. Graceful and kind, the Sylphs are the gentle and friendly wind
fairies. They are always celebrating and the joyous atmosphere is even more festive
thanks to the brightly colored flowers and reeds, and the bright green leaves. Lively
and cheerful, the queen spreads joy wherever she goes and loves to watch the court
games. Which are the most popular? If the PCs participate, they are rewarded with the
Rebirth Leaf, a rare accessory that increases all healing received by 5.
 The Summer Court. The fire Salamanders are quite famous for their exuberant
and mischievous temperament. Their main color is red. A sweltering breeze makes
this area extremely hot and causes the tree’s fruits to mature very quickly. How do
Salamanders enjoy this climate? Their queen is prickly, annoying, and loves to play
pranks. Nevertheless, when taking a rest, the PCs can enjoy the hot springs, which
grant Resistance to fire damage until the end of the next conflict.
 The Autumn Court. Mild-mannered and calm, the earth Dryads, characterized by the
yellow color, are generous but very shy. Among the denizens of the tree, they feel the
deepest connection with it. There is never a quiet moment at court: the Dryads are
constantly preparing for a winter that will never come, while leaves fall all around.
How can the PCs help them? The queen is mellow and agreeable, her words bringing
peace and calm to those who listen. She rewards any help with a set of Gnarled Armor,
which Absorbs earth damage, but makes the wearer Vulnerable to fire.
 The Winter Court. The ice Undines are blue-colored, haughty, contemptuous,
bold, prideful, and easy to offend. A chilling wind makes this area positively frigid.
Everything is covered in white snow, and the tree branches are withered and empty.
Locked within the palace, Undines pass their time engaged in typical court activities,
unaware of what is happening outside. What are their main activities? The queen is
icy and stern, and her appearance commands respect. If the PCs demonstrate that
they are up to the court’s standards, they receive as a gift the Tiara of Tears, a rare
accessory that increases the wearer’s Willpower die by one size.

b ECHOING RUINS
The remains of ancient machines emerge from the undergrowth alongside the metal
fuselage of a huge airship, now crushed by tree roots. The only creatures that live in
these forgotten ruins are constructs, intent on an endless cycle of repairs.
 Echoing ruins. Ancient technology is preserved here. Deciphering the old logs and
restarting the main console, the PCs discover that this technology is not from the
known world. Which epoch does it come from?
 Lost technology. Strange weapons and tools of unknown function lay under the
dust inside the fuselage. The PCs might find rare pieces of equipment, recharge their
Inventory Points, or decipher an ancient and forgotten alphabet. What kind of tools
do they find? What were they designed for? How do they function?
 Cold Fusion. The belly of the ship hides an artifact that can generate infinite energy.
The device now exists symbiotically with the last of the lumenflies, an ancient
species of giant firefly considered extinct. The artifact’s heat is necessary for the eggs
to hatch, but someone wants to use its power to fight a decisive battle. Who are they?
Is it possible to find a compromise?
? PROTECTION WANTED
The heroes stumble upon a caravan of traveling merchants. They are not familiar with
this region and they aren’t confident to continue without an escort.
 Imperatrix. This creature has ruled the skies of the Cerulean Jungle since time
immemorial. Despite her fierce appearance, she prefers to nest up in the mountains
and has never attacked the denizens of the forest… until now. She boasts a terrifying
dive attack that holds down the target until the end of the round, dealing damage
and inflicting slow, but she can also breathe searing flames. When in Crisis, she can
hit up to two targets during a dive and inflict poisoned with her tail sting. She is
Vulnerable to ice and bolt damage, but Immune to fire and poison.
 Something unsaid. In a cage on the central cart is the Imperatrix’s offspring, which
the merchants stole from the nest. Only the inestimable value of such a creature
pushed them to take such a risk. If the PCs discover the truth, the merchants try to
buy their silence. If someone returns her lost hatchling, the mother returns to the
mountains without causing further damage to the forest. What will the PCs do?
“Respect nature and it will respect you. Trample even
a single flower and it will take back what was stolen
from it. Everything has a place in this ecosystem!”

THE EERIE VILLAGE

Darkdepth
Ancient legends tell of the strange village hidden in the darkest and humid depths
of the great forest, inhabited by mysterious, inhuman creatures who appear as silent
shadows when a traveler is in mortal danger, only to promptly drag their body into the
murky depths of the undergrowth. This putrid and rotten place does not belong to the
living, and no one return from it.

CHAPTER
9 TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Eerie Village should include at least one of these features:
 An ecological or spiritual role that scares or disgusts humans.
 A completely unique population.
 A natural or magical resource not found elsewhere.
 A protector figure with an inscrutable or difficult personality.
9 POSITION
Locations like Darkdepth may appear as a discovery during a journey or be introduced
with a Fabula Point, but more often they are a turning point of the campaign, an
allegory of the main themes of the story that the group can engage with and even
directly talk to. For example, Darkdepth is linked to the fear of death and the instinctive
repulsion for decay and rotting, in spite of the fact that these processes are inevitable
and essential to creating new life.
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Some Villains might see the Eerie Village as a precious source of power, others
might plan to destroy it to wipe out its influence over the environment – ignoring
or underestimating the consequences of such an act. From this point of view, the
Eerie Village symbolizes the need to learn why we have to protect what we don’t
understand and, sometimes, even what scares us.

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Darkdepth into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ SAPROBES’ VILLAGE
From outside, Darkdepth looks like the ruins of an ancient village, plunged in a murky
hollow in the undergrowth. Some buildings are still visible in the dim light, their walls
covered in mold and roofs swelling from spores and mucilage.
 Far from the surface. Reaching Darkdepth isn’t easy: one must wade through the
dense mud of the forest to a maze of underground caves, or follow the roots of
centuries-old trees until light fades and air becomes suffocating. Who or what is
going to guide the PCs to the village? What are their intentions?
 The saprobes. The villagers are silent creatures who communicate using subtle
movements and often remain immobile, as if they’re listening. They are vaguely
humanoid in shape, but their decaying fungal bodies are all different. Many wear jewels
created by stringing together the most disparate items; bone, wood, glass and ceramic
are the most common, but some saprobes add metal pins and earrings to their gill caps.
Which of the PCs recognizes a familiar symbol or item? Why does this disturb them?
 Leto. Tall and thin, Leto distinguishes himself from the other saprobes with his
interest in humans. He collects and preserves a great number of books and notes,
going so far as to learn the basics of some languages and dialects. The PCs’ arrival
excites and worries him at the same time: he’s willing to explain the nature and
origin of saprobes, but he wants to know more about the surface world in exchange.
He also asks the group not to reveal the location of Darkdepth to nearby villages,
because he “learned from his books that humanity isn’t patient or sympathetic”.
What is the saprobes’s role? Why do they appear when someone’s life is in danger?
What answers are hidden among Leto’s dusty tomes? What happened to the original
inhabitants of Darkdepth?
 Bargain Alley. The long hollow of a fallen tree has become a gathering place for
saprobes, who come here to trade items of every sort – those found upon the corpses
brought to Darkdepth. Some are really ancient, others extremely new. Saprobes don’t
use money and are outraged if someone asks to buy some of the jewelry they adorn
themselves with. Why is that? What kind of link do they have with the items they
choose to wear?

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
b THE DEPTHS OF THE GREAT TREE
Following a group of saprobes carrying a corpse to Darkdepths, the PCs venture among
the giant roots of a titanic tree, completely covered with fungi. Its trunk, surrounded by
glowing spores, merges with the cave’s ceiling and the surface ground.
 Marshille. Sitting among the depths of the roots is a giant woman with harsh, sharp
features. She wears a cobweb tunic and a large fungal cap. Her pale fingers end
in extremely long nails, with which she traces occult symbols in the air with fine
precision. The giantess speaks many languages and introduces herself as “guest and
sister” of the saprobes. Is she a descendant of the people that lived here in the past?
 Life in death. Marshille has no problem explaining her role in Darkdepth: every
creature that dies in the area is brought to her, so that her magic might breathe new
life into the tree and the entire forest, not to mention the saprobes themselves. How
do the PCs react to this revelation? Do they think that it is legitimate to deny the
mourning families a final farewell for the good of the forest, considering those same
families draw sustenance from its fruits?
? THE DRAKE EXPEDITION
Seraphina Drake, a young and enterprising magician from the Central Academy, is
organizing an expedition to locate Darkdepth and research the mysterious power that,
according to her, controls life and death in the entire forest. She is offering a generous
salary to those who escort her and ensure her safety.
 Mercenaries. Anxious for results, Seraphina hired some ex-military. Which of the PCs has
dealt with them in the past? What burning defeat still torments these soldiers? Who is
their leader and how long do they actually plan on following the magician’s orders?
 Henrietta Drake. Seraphina’s younger sister accompanies the expedition and handles
logistics and upkeep, but she is concerned about her sister’s impatience and the
mercenaries’ methods. Her blood ties with Seraphina make her an ideal hostage.
 Temptation. After reaching Darkdepth and discovering its ties with the life of the
forest, the expedition breaks apart: Henrietta and the mercenaries have very different
priorities and this will no doubt lead to a Villain emerging (maybe two, depending
on the circumstances). Which side, if any, do the PCs take? Do the villagers have any
chance to fight back? How will the forest react to this threat?
“We do not feel joy in delivering your corpses to the roots
of this old tree, but we do so with pride and respect, yes.”

THE CENTRAL CITY
W
The great city of Eisenstadt rises magnificently among the hills, in stark contrast with
the surrounding countryside, which has been progressively abandoned over the last
few years and is riddled with windworn megaliths, crumbled mounds and abandoned
iron mines. As the seat of both the Alchemists’ College and the Government Bureau, it’s
for all intents and purposes the industrial, political and economic capital of the region,
not to mention the destination of all who seek a Special Alchemist License.

9 TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Central City should include at least one of these features:
 A school or academy that explores new disciplines.
 An enterprising but arrogant middle class.
 Traces of a past culture that very few talk about.
 A merchant quarter, the true hub of all major trade routes.
9 POSITION
A location like Eisenstadt often represents a transformative moment in the campaign.
Here, the protagonists might find incomplete answers to some questions, meet
new allies and, perhaps, buy some brand new equipment and a flying or seaworthy
transport. The Central City is also a great opportunity to introduce new threats and
start the second half of the campaign.
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Eisenstadt is the largest city in the region, distinguished by its high technological
level, easy access to numerous resources, and an ambitious and individualistic society:
fertile ground for a Villain. This kind of location tends to present strictly humanoid
antagonists, such as greedy merchants, callous industrialists, and alchemists or
inventors willing to accept daunting risks in the name of progress.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Which one of you has been to Eisenstadt before, and why?
Has it changed much compared to your memories?
 The city is large and noisy. Which one of you feels lost?
Who has that enthusiastic shine in their eyes?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Eisenstadt into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ ALCHEMISTS’ COLLEGE
One of the most impressive buildings in Eisenstadt, the College was built on ancient
foundations, but it has been renovated many times over the years to integrate special
pipes and remedy a few “accidents” caused by overzealous researchers.
 The Commission. Led by Dean Elsholtz, it is a mandatory path to receiving a Special
License and freely practice alchemy. The Commission replaced the previous individual
apprenticeship system with a curriculum aimed at industrial development, removing
most of the philosophical and anthropological studies, especially any reference to
forbidden alchemical techniques. Who among the PCs thinks this was a reprehensible
decision? Who deems it reasonable or understandable?
 The classrooms. Ten ample halls, designed for both theoretical and practical lessons,
occupy the third and fourth floor of the College. What is the most unusual subject
taught here? Which of the professors shows some interest in the Player Characters?
Are there any known faces?
 Highflame Library. As emphasized by its bright blue crest, the College considers
knowledge similar to fire, and its purest expression is an intense but controlled flame,
which gave name to this colossal library. What legendary tome is kept here? Who can
give permission to read it and who wants to prevent it at all cost? And why?
 The kiln. The College’s underground level includes a network of boilers which provide
energy to the entire complex, and also a series of passages and rooms, connected to
the sewers, which contain the more-or-less stable remnants of old experiments. Who
or what guards this area? Who has an interest in recovering something from this
maze of dangerous junk?
 Inner quarter. Just as thick walls separate Eisenstadt from the countryside, towering
fences isolate the merchant and middle-class quarters from the College district,
where one can find specialized stores, luxury apartments for the Dean and professors,
plus a club for the licensed alchemists. Almost no students live in this district.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
b THE CROMLECH
These megalithic complexes are characteristic of the hills around Eisenstadt, but a few
can also be found inside the city in public and private parks. The hill folks worship them,
while the city folks disregard them.
 Weathered words. Time almost completely wiped out the engravings on the
megaliths, hiding their true meaning from scholars. However, rumor has it a
miraculously intact stele can be found in the garden of Governor Bauer. Which of
the PCs have studied these megaliths or encountered others like them? How can
one visit the Governor’s estate?
 The pattern. Although only partial complexes have survived, the placement of the
cromlech looks anything but random. According to local folklore, magical stones
were used to commemorate the departed and honor the pact between humanity
and fairy folk, not to mention ensuring the locals’ safety by keeping a dangerous
nocturnal predator at bay. Who proposed conducting research on equal grounds
with the local shepherds, but was mocked and ostracized? Which strange events
seem to give them credit?
? THE HUNT FOR REDGLOVE ERIKA
The city watch captain has placed a 5000 zenit bounty on the head of the mysterious
outlaw known as Redglove Erika, who is sabotaging kilns and alchemical factories
across the region, recently striking at Eisenstadt itself.
 Traces. Erika’s most recent attack was on an experimental boiler; as usual, the machinery
was damaged beyond repair despite no one being harmed in the accident, and a scarletpainted
glove was found. What do the PCs think about it? Have any of them crossed
paths with Erika in the past or suspect her true identity? What was the purpose of the
experimental boiler, and what about it seems suspicious or questionable?
 Ashes. Erika (minor Villain) is a 60 year old alchemist, jaded and pessimistic, who
considers the teachings of the College dangerously shallow and prefers to destroy the
alchemical arts rather than letting a bunch of idiots (or worse, bureaucrats!) abuse them.
In battle, she is flanked by spirits of air, fire, ice and earth, who make her Immune to
their respective elements and let her unleash elemental attacks that drain Mind Points
and Inventory Points. Which of the PCs understands or approves of her actions? Is there
anyone who might show her that people still respect alchemy in its true complexity, and
rather than bury its darkest secrets would research them to better contrast their use?
“This morning we visited the Expo, boutique
shopping in the afternoon, then a tour of the city walls
and a night concert! Sleeping? Sleeping is for losers!”

9 TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Remote Ruin should include at least one of these features:
 A unique defensive or cloaking system.
 An unbelievably ancient creature that protects part of the location.
 Great mosaics or paintings depicting the history of the world.
 An artifact that should have never been unearthed.
9 POSITION
A Remote Ruin is a classic turning point – inaccessible to the protagonists for a good
chunk of the story, reaching it means finding a new perspective upon the world… and
discovering its most ancient shadows.This is rarely the end point of the adventure, on
the contrary, this is where the protagonists fully realize the magnitude of their task,
but they might come back here once they find a solution.
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Usually, the Remote Ruin and its amazing secrets are the main objectives of one or
more Villains from the beginning of the campaign. This could be the lair of some
ancient evil, but it’s also possible that the entity living here is just gloomy and in pain,
easy prey for the Villain’s deceptions. If such a creature realizes that they have been
used again, rage and desperation might turn them into a terrible scourge. Only the
Player Characters can find a way to save the creature and the world.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 What allows this place to float among the clouds?
Why did time never touch the remains of this ancient civilization?
 A keeper ensures that none squander the secrets of the ancients by wasting
them on deaf ears. Who are they? How do they fulfill their duty?
 This place reawakens some lost memories in you. Which one of you has been
here before? If this was once your home, why did you leave?
 Strangers are forbidden to enter the city. How did you get in here?
What is the penalty for trespassers?
 A deep sense of emptiness and gloom hangs in the air.

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Golden City into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE CELESTIAL GARDENS
These magnificent vertical gardens climb up into the sky. Vibrant and gargantuan
flowers of unusual colors, meandering vines, and other plants with incomprehensible
genetics embellish streets and walls, but hidden within are the sad truths of a lost
civilization. There isn’t even a drop of water. What is the secret of these plants’ vitality?
Why does flora look so different in this place?
 The unliving. These mannequin-like creatures have been deprived of humanity.
With pale and expressionless features, they aimlessly wander through streets and
alleyways. Who are these creatures? For what purpose were they created?
 A cruel experiment. Forced to wander eternally, a hybrid similar to a shapeless
chimera slowly walks every path of the gardens. They have no defined shape, looking
more like a heterogeneous mass of animal limbs. Their eyes look almost human and
show sadness and resignation. If the PCs try to speak to them, a human head and
torso rise from beneath the skin. The hybrid isn’t evil and fights only in self-defense
(their attacks are unpredictable and the Affinities change every turn). What is the true
nature of this experiment? Which animals made up their amorphous body?
 A harsh reality. Paintings and frescoes decorate gardens’ inner walls. Studying them
for a while, Player Characters may discover a terrible truth about this experimental
greenhouse: it was the theater of macabre and obsessive experimentation. Here,
a now forgotten culture manipulated life itself and molded nature and humanity
according to a very detailed plan. Who were they? What was their ultimate goal,
and what interrupted their plan? Which of campaign’s main antagonists made
such an obsession their own, to the point of trying to complete the work of these
merciless visionaries?
b NOT ALL THAT GLITTERS IS GOLD
The glow of the Golden City shines beyond the clouds. Thousands of luminous particles
shimmer among the ruins, residuum of the essences that have returned to the stream
of souls. And yet, the heart of the city is grim and dark. The secret of its civilization
must remain buried and no living being should ever set foot in the Golden City.
49

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Cradle of life. The Golden City is where souls are purified and reprogrammed for their
next birth according to a precise scheme. Instead of following the spontaneous chaos
of nature, they are cleansed of all memories and forced to reincarnate according to
the designs of an ancient entity, descendant of a forgotten people. Who were they?
What caused their disappearance? Why did they manipulate the stream of souls to
the point of replacing it?
 Deus Ex. The heir to the will of the ancients appears as a colossal bronze statue,
a humanoid angel with two feathered right wings and a female body, and a crying
face in place of the left arm. Its true essence (supreme Villain) is sealed in the head,
protected by a helmet that covers its eyes and monitors all the city’s functions. It
has been doing this since time immemorial, draining the spirits of any intruders
and turning them into pale shadows of themselves. Deus Ex is Immune to physical
damage, and alternates between Vulnerability and Absorption to light and dark each
round, unleashing attacks based upon the Absorbed element and inflicting random
status effects. It also controls the mechanical sentries of the entire Golden City and
can spend Ultima Points to summon them to fight at its side. In reality, its spirit
silently mourns its millennia-old separation from the stream of souls – can the Player
Characters help them reunite with it, and how?
? CASTAWAYS OF THE SKY
Will and Orvy, two reckless aviators, lost control of their aerostat and crashed among
the ruins while escaping a deadly spirit. In helping them, the PCs become embroiled in
a violent conflict.
 Necroptes. This ravenous winged spirit can smell death and knows no remorse.
They cast fire and air spells and, although fragile, can strike down opponents in
Crisis with their terrible Death spell, which reduces the victims’ Hit Points to 0 if
they were a multiple of 5. They are Vulnerable to cold and light damage, Immune
to earth and Absorb dark.
 Collateral damage. If the Necroptes isn’t defeated within 4 rounds of conflict, the
aerostat becomes unusable due to collateral damage.
 Rest in peace. After the end of the conflict, Will and Orvy take a breather and explain
the reason for their journey – they are fulfilling their father’s last request: scatter his
ashes from the highest point in the sky. If the aerostat is still serviceable, they take
off. Otherwise, can the PCs figure out a solution?
“This is where it all began – maybe for fun, boredom or desperation.
The memory is lost, the truth ignored, and the answers denied.”

 An underwater cave where mysterious plants grow.
 A cliff with an old lighthouse.
 A dangerous island that can be reached only under special conditions.
9 POSITION
Locations like the Sunny Bay are often used at the start of the adventure. It might be a
place where the people of the protagonists’ village gather and celebrate, or the stage
for the first scenes of the campaign, perhaps during a test of courage when something
goes horribly wrong, causing the PCs to work together for the first time.
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Usually, a place such as Lowtide is of no consequence to the Villains, but it might
provide the perfect opportunity to meet with an accomplice or kidnap some isolated
and unaware individual. Over the course of the campaign, a Villain might land here
or make the beach their lair, preventing the locals from entering, or turning it into a
tourist trap, without any regard for the environment and the creatures that live here.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 One of you was born on the island. What are your childhood memories?

$ THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE CLIFF
At the top of a cliff overlooking the sea, hidden by thick vegetation, is an old disused
lighthouse – a picturesque and oft-forgotten sight.
 Crab cave. A partially submerged cave leads directly into the cliff. Giant crabs with
strange carvings on their carapaces have taken refuge from the currents here. They
aren’t aggressive, but react if someone attacks or gets too close. What is the meaning
of those carvings? Has one of the PCs ever seen something similar?
 The lighthouse. This ancient building rises atop the cliff. Completely covered in
creeping vines, the lighthouse lays forgotten in this remote part of the promontory. It
dates back to ancient times – perhaps it was built by the ancestors of the bay’s current
residents. The lantern found at the top is decorated with strange paintings and frescoes,
depicting a flaming bird. Who built the lighthouse? What was its original purpose?
 Golden egg. Resting on the old lantern’s base, this object is craved by researchers
and smugglers. Nobody knows who the real owner is, nor how it came to be here,
and none has been brave enough to move it. Gathering enough evidence, the Player
Characters may discover that the tower was the nest of an ancient creature who used
the lantern’s light as a waypoint to return home, but that fire has been out for a long
time. What kind of egg is it? Where is the mother?
 Curlybeard, the self-proclaimed Pirate King. While inside the lantern room, an old
sea dog looking for the egg (see above) attacks the PCs. He fights with an old pistol
and a rusty cutlass, which can inflict weak. When he enters Crisis, the pirate grabs the
egg and attempts to escape (a 4 section Clock, with one section automatically filled
at the end of each round). As the singed beard might suggest, the pirate is Vulnerable
to fire damage, but Resistant to ice and air. During the fight, the PCs feel the earth
shake and the cries of a strange creature getting closer each round – perhaps the
mother is coming back to protect the egg? If so, would she unleash her fury only upon
Curlybeard? Or the protagonists as well?

b THE CORAL FOREST
At low tide, a thick coral forest emerges from the sea, painting the atmosphere with
bright hues.
 The coral labyrinth. It’s easy to get lost in this living maze. Finding the exit requires
filling an 8 section Clock. Each time they fail, the PCs bump into an unwelcome snag,
such as a shoal of marine creatures, sharp poisonous corals or they feel a terrible
sense of disorientation (dazed status effect).
 The flooded temple. At the heart of the labyrinth lies an ancient ruin and in its main
chamber, inaccessible to humans, is the ancient Horn of Tides. Built by an amphibious
people that lived on the coast, the temple is now the lair of a giant moray eel. She
isn’t aggressive, but values quiet, so she vehemently urges the PCs to face the Trial of
Currents (see below) to recover the artifact… omitting a few details.
 The Trial. At the mercy of thundering currents, the heroes feel bitter memories
emerging, but of what kind? Each Player Character that manages to explain how one
of their Bonds would have helped on that occasion will slowly be cradled by currents,
and led before the Horn. What kind of power does this artifact give?
? THE DAMAGED BOAT
Stranded on the coast, the unlucky fisherman Orus needs materials protected by
dangerous plant creatures to fix his badly damaged boat.
 Wood Guardians. If the PCs try to establish contact with the protectors of the forest,
they are brought before the sacred tree, a millennia-old magnolia always in bloom.
All living creatures in the area protect and worship it, grateful for its gifts. What can
be discovered by communicating with the magnolia? What compromise does it offer?
 Violence is not the way. If the PCs try to use force to get wood for the fisherman, or if
they try to get rid of the forest creatures, the voice of the sacred tree echoes in their
mind, ordering them to stop. What punishment awaits them if they don’t comply?
 The fisherman’s gratitude. If the group returns empty handed, Orus understands the
need to respect the local laws and thanks the PCs for their help, showing them the
location of a mysterious island that doesn’t appear on any map. If they get the wood,
he offers to take them to the island with his own boat. What kind of island is it? Which
of the PCs has heard of it? What does it hide?

 The remains of an arrogant or unfortunate civilization.
9 POSITION
Often, the journey across the Barren Waste appears mid-adventure or in the second
half, and represents a coming-of-age moment for the protagonists, as well as an
occasion to consolidate their goals and friendship. By facing the desert and meeting
those who have learned how to coexist with it, Player Characters learn to appreciate
and respect even the cruelest and most inhospitable parts of their world… and how
certain thresholds should never be crossed.
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Some Villains might use the Rocky Desert as their hideout or lair, or plan to use local
resources, precious yet unstable, to the detriment of its people. A particularly ancient
Villain might even remember when this was a prosperous land and become obsessed
with mirages of past glory… or they might be a spirit born of the desperation of those
who witnessed the catastrophe that made this territory arid and inhospitable.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 An unusual phenomenon appears regularly in the desert. It’s known as
“crimson rain”, but it’s not water. What is it?
 One of you knows the desert and how to navigate it. What’s your story?
Do you have a contact that might help you cross it?
 Here and there, ruins of a lost civilization pierce the sand.
Which people did they belong to? What is left of them?
 How did the desert people adapt to these arid lands?
What threat makes it dangerous to cross the sands?
 An ancient alchemical project lays dormant under the sand.
What is it? What was its purpose? Who is looking for it?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Rocky Desert into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich
the story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ RUSTSALT CANYON
An area of canyons filled with sharp rocks and salt crystals. Among sand and stone
emerge grooves and metal remains of what seems to be a centuries-old railway, an
attempt to connect settlements destroyed by the passing of time.
 Ancient railway. The ruins of this monumental endeavor have been almost completely
dismantled and repurposed by the locals. In particular, its opaque metal is ideal to
forge very robust tools and pieces of equipment.
 The desert people. Accustomed to the desert, the inhabitants have learned to
appreciate what it has to offer and recognize beauty where others see only danger.
They have a symbiotic relationship with the Rocksoarers, creatures unfit for hunting
who instead feed upon the parasites found on desert whales, and also cultivate a
variety of plants and shrubs unique to this region.
 A slice of paradise. If the locals consider them worthy of trust, the PCs are invited to
witness a rare spectacle. In a specific location, under a sky of stars, they can hear the
song of the desert whale, a majestic creature that lives under the sand, emerging only
during the cold nights to draw breath. What is the relationship between the whales
and the desert people? Why do they live only in a certain area?
 The sea of sand. This endless waste is dangerous and impossible to cross on foot, but
that doesn’t dissuade the desert people who, using swift, floating boats, constantly
probe the sands looking for ancient relics. What are they really looking for? How do
these vehicles work?
b BURIED LABYRINTH
An obscure enigma is buried under the sand, in the heart of a maze of tunnels and
underground roads. Narrow passages, theater to forgotten experiments, spread
through the ground. Among flasks and alembics, enigmatic notes preserved in dusty
diaries suggest the researchers were working on a device that could reverse the
fortunes of the desert’s inhabitants.

CHAPTER
 Condenser. This powerful artifact is the result of many years of secret experiments
underground. It can extract all water contained in both organic and inorganic matter,
making it dry and barren. The tank is inexplicably full. This device could be a game
changer for the desert people, but nobody remembers how to use it. What are the PCs
going to do? What are the potential consequences of using such a device?
 Failed experiment. The Condenser proved unstable and became a death sentence for
the entire city. Stripped of all fluids, its inhabitants have been reduced to withered
skeletons that slumber in undeath. They can survive without water and jealously guard
their memories, especially those of their mistakes.
 The Nameless Queen. Once sovereign to the surface and first among alchemists, this
minor Villain hides her mummified body under heavy, jeweled cloaks. Despite being
an undead with murky memories, she still has a knack for the alchemical arts and can
unleash devastating fire spells or summon servants of sand and bones, who explode
when destroyed. If defeated, the Queen regains enough lucidity to answer a few
questions before disintegrating.
? A RARE FLOWER
An old nomad from the village wishes to commemorate his late wife by planting the
seed of an extraordinarily rare flower next to her tomb.
 Dalen. His weary body prevents him from traveling the desert alone, but his wisdom
is without equal. Dalen is looking for the Snaplion, a flower that grows only in the
heart of the Rocky Desert. It was his wife’s favorite, but those that blossomed next to
her tomb have now withered. If the PCs agree to accompany him, they receive a +2
bonus to Open Tests to obtain information about the desert.
 Myrmidon. Similar to a giant antlion, this creature lays in ambush in a sandpit, luring
prey with floral antennae. At the start of the conflict, Myrmidon inflicts slow on all
enemies, then strikes with its powerful mandibles or the Guillotine spell (same as
Omega; see Core Rulebook, page 193). It can burrow into the sand, drawing slow
opponents into its maw, causing heavy damage. It is Immune to earth damage,
Resistant to fire and Vulnerable to ice and air.
 Farewell. After defeating Myrmidon, it becomes clear there are no more Snaplions,
outside of the fake flower the creature used as a lure. What are the PCs going to say
to Dalen?
“The desert sand buries the mistakes of the past,
but it cannot erase them, only hide them.”

CHAPTER
9 TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Freezing Mountain should include at least one of these features:
 A dangerous path in a state of disarray.
 A small settlement hiding ancient knowledge.
 An ancient structure, extremely hard to reach.
 A terrible beast that no hunter dares to face.
9 POSITION
Locations such as Vertigo Peak represent the climax of the adventure and the final
test of the Player Character’s abilities. Unforgiving weather and dangerous creatures
make this the ideal setting for the final act of a campaign. Furthermore, these locations
are often situated near a corner of the map sheet, far from all the main settlements
and shrouded in myth and legends.
9 THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Vertigo Peak is so remote and dangerous that a common Villain would hesitate to
use it as their base of operation. It’s far more likely for it to be the abode of a simple
and brutal threat, a terrible catastrophe looming over the rest of the world. The
mountain might also be the birthplace of a recurring Villain, where the heroes can
finally discover the antagonist’s past and understand how this merciless land shaped
their motivations.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 This is an extremely coveted hunting reserve. Which of the local creatures
threaten the ecosystem? What would happen if they were not contained?
 A recent and sudden climate shift wreaked havoc on the mountain.
What was the cause? How did the toughest species adapt to it?
 A decaying structure towers among the clouds. What is it?
What was its original function? Who or what occupies it now?
 To fend off local wildlife, the denizens of the region developed
an ingenious defensive strategy. How does it work?
 Among local hunters, one shines for their skill. What do they
have in common with one of you? What are they known for?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Vertigo Peak into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich
the story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ HUNTING VILLAGE
The inhabitants of this settlement work hard to preserve the delicate balance of the
ecosystem, making sure the largest and most dangerous creatures don’t descend upon
the valley, where the population won’t be able to fend them off.
 The hamlet. The local hunters learned not to waste anything, to use everything they
harvest from their prey to show respect for their “sacrifice”. Despite their harsh and
rough personalities, tempered by the difficulties and hardship that they endure, they
offer shelter to the travelers. What are the key traditions of these people? Why did
they adopt this particular philosophy?
 Dragon Fang. A gigantic weapon used to defend the village from aggressive creatures,
this massive harpoon was fashioned from an ancient and unbreakable bone-like
material, but the identity of the creature it comes from has been lost to time. What
actually is the Dragon Fang? What creature did it belong to?
 The old hunter. His vast scars tell many stories, including those he is unwilling to
share. This silent veteran was forced to retire after an unfortunate hunting accident
– he was the sole survivor of the expedition, after which he became withdrawn and
stopped talking. Who is this old hunter? What accident caused him to retire? What
discovery caused him to mistrust everybody?
b CALAMITY KEEP
This vast and partially ruined castle was built over the original lair of the dragons,
powerful creatures now forgotten among the echoes of the past. Only the boldest and
most foolish dare trudge the path to this ancient building.
 Lost path. Many are the dangers hidden along this route. To reach the castle, the
PCs have to complete a 10 section Clock. With each failed Check, the Game Master
introduces one of the dangers of Vertigo Peak – landslides, sudden fatigue, an abrupt
snowstorm or a pack of opportunistic predators.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 The great hall. This massive hall has seen better days and, after a partial collapse,
most of the exits are blocked. However, the main structure is solid and only a fool
would blame its disrepair on the passage of time. Inside the castle, the PCs can find
weapons from ages past, brandished in an ancient battle. The keep also has ancient
defense mechanisms, such as ballistae and arquebuses.
 Eternal grudge. Scattered among the ruins, tapestries and trophies tell the tale of an
age past, when dragons ruled the mountain – until some “champions” exterminated
them… except for one, who fled into the northern mists. The last surviving knight,
heavy with remorse, foresaw the creature’s return.
 Funeris. In ancient times, this colossal demon (major Villain) experienced mankind’s
vainglory firsthand. Being the last of their kind and tormented by the souls of dead
dragons, they want revenge. Enveloping the mountain’s side, Funeris is vast enough
to be split into three parts: head, tail and claws, each Resistant and Vulnerable to
different elements (the color of the scales provides a clue). They can breathe fire,
which ignores Resistances, and also an explosive powder that increases the damage
of subsequent attacks. The long tail strikes enemies with multi (3), while the
powerful claws can grab a PC, temporarily separating them from the rest of the group.
Whenever a part is defeated, Funeris takes off and skips his turns, while preparing
to unleash a fearsome cataclysm: if the PCs fail to activate the keep’s defenses (a 6
section Clock) by the end of the following round, they all drop to 0 Hit Points. If they
succeed, Funeris’ remaining parts re-enter the conflict.
? ALBERT
A young and inexperienced explorer-photographer, Albert isn’t equipped to face the
mountain. He wants to make a name for himself photographing a rare animal that
lives only here. Being too green to succeed, he asks the PCs for help.
 Unwanted attention. Albert isn’t evil, just dangerously naive. His articles caught the
attention of hunters and trappers who want to make a trophy out of his next subject.
Which infamous hunter is following his tracks? Which of the PCs has dealt with them
in the past?
 Qilin. While exploring, the group is caught by a sudden snowstorm. A neigh cuts through
the wind, but no horses live on Vertigo Peak – the PCs have stumbled upon a qilin, an
ancient chimera with the body of a deer and the head of a unicorn. Who among them
knows the nature of the qilins and their role as benevolent messengers? Which lucky
event does this one foretell? Who reacts with suspicion or violence to them?
“The mountain is harsh but fair. No matter if predator
or prey: the true sovereign of the food chain is adaptability.”

W
CONFLICTS
The following pages provide suggestions to help you build natural fantasy conflicts.
They explore these situations from a rules perspective – which the Core Rulebook
also discusses at length from page 58 – but, more importantly, they focus on the
narrative tensions at play during clashes between individuals or factions.
IGNORANCE AND FEAR
Natural fantasy conflicts are extremely varied, but all share one common element:
the will of one or more contenders to act before fully understanding the nature of
the problem and the possible consequences. They often do so out of fear of what they
don’t know how to control or understand.
The simple answers are seldom the correct ones. Prejudice and fear might cause
irreparable damage but, at the same time, one can’t wait forever. This contradiction
is at the heart of natural fantasy and something that has no simple solution – on
the contrary, this particular style of game hinges upon doing your best, acting out of
generosity and taking responsibility for your mistakes.
When creating situations based on these dynamics, you should pay attention to:
 Fear and shame. Someone feels in danger: it might just be due to survival instinct,
but it can also arise out of fear of losing credibility, power, or control, or the growing
realization that one’s worldview is naive or incomplete.
 Neglected teachings. Traditions, legends, stories, and relics remind us of similar
situations from the past, but the factions or contenders involved are unaware of
them, willfully ignore them or (even worse!) misinterpret them to fan the flames of
conflict instead of solving it.
 Pride and prejudice. The contenders often have a shallow opinion of their opponent,
and stubbornly refuse any chance of compromise, convinced that their actions are an
unfortunate necessity or inherently “righteous”.
 Long-term consequences. Every conflict is going to have an aftermath that the
contenders do not understand or choose to ignore, usually because they believe it
won’t really come to pass, won’t involve them directly or is preferable to any other
alternative regardless.
 A glimmer of hope. In all these situations, there is always a chance for negotiation
and dialogue that people are ignoring, and that is exactly where Player Characters
come into play and show their support.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
MISTAKES OF THE PAST, HOPES OF THE PRESENT
Natural fantasy stories don’t focus just on the immediate and brutal pain caused by
exploiting the land, oppressing people and uprooting traditions and cultures. On the
contrary, they argue that such actions are going to have very long-term consequences,
much longer than the life expectancy of those involved, and that to heal such wounds
we will need not only the ability to understand and forgive, but also the self-awareness
and courage to take a step back and change our point of view.
The price of past cruelties falls upon the people of the present, and the price of
present cruelty will fall on the people of the future.
The recurring leitmotifs of the genre include neglectfulness, the rediscovery of ancient
and terrible technologies, curses (often generational or cyclical), and the idea that the
protagonists have to endure and overcome the consequences of the past, taking care
not to cause the same suffering to future generations.
If you are running low on inspiration, you can rely upon some natural fantasy classics
and their related conflicts:
 Catastrophic artifacts. Magical or technological items infused with almost miraculous
powers reemerging from ancient times. They represent a temptation for both the
hopeless and those who crave power and authority, but in both cases these tools will
unleash a devastation that the planet was trying to forget.
 Punishment incarnate. Curses, plagues and epidemics might be the ecosystem’s
answer to atrocities committed by civilizations past – they often force animals, spirits,
and machines to act in a destructive manner, and assume a full physical form only
towards the end of the campaign.
 Millennia-old progenies. Simple in terms of narrative premise yet extremely
dangerous, these opponents are the result of century-old (perhaps millennia-old)
experiments to create better weapons or eliminate pollution and radiation. They
might be biological creatures or huge out-of-control machines.
Further advice and suggestions on which Villains to use depending on the situation
can be found in Chapter 4: Antagonists.
64
W
W
THE PRICE OF PEACE
The idea that natural fantasy must have a bucolic aesthetic and deal with small,
peaceful villages is superficial to say the least: a large number of these stories take
a different twist, highlighting the difficulties in human relationships. Sometimes they
are just the inner conflicts of a village or a family, but tales of violence and oppression
between neighboring nations are equally common, not to mention the marginalization
of one or more individuals who called local dogmas into question.
Traditions are important and they were probably created for a good reason, but
this might not be the case any longer: blindly following them might lead to grave
misjudgments. At the same time, discarding them for profit or power is equally cruel
and irresponsible.
In line with the themes of change and coexistence that permeate the natural fantasy
genre, peace isn’t static, but something that must be redefined day by day, based on
new necessities, otherwise it becomes an oppressive silence.
WHEN WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH
Many natural fantasy conflicts involve factions who struggle to communicate: these
disputes often take the form of wars between humans and animals, monsters, or
spirits, but the idea also works in the case of rivalries or tension between nations that
don’t speak the same language.
Some character options allow the PCs to communicate with usually unintelligible
creatures and powers – for example, Elemental Harmony (see page 155), Feral
Speech (see Core Rulebook, page 183) and some Rituals. These are excellent choices
if you want one of the protagonists to act as a mediator, but you might avoid them on
purpose, so that the group has to struggle with the difficulties of communication (a
character might acquire them later to show their evolution).
In such situations, it’s important to highlight the values of hospitality and
understanding: if the story includes a presence considered “alien” or “outsider”, the
heroes’ first instinct should be to suspend judgment to understand its point of view,
needs, and necessities, instead of driving it back, fighting or eliminating it. Although
defending oneself from a raging monster or making contact with destructive spirits is
rather common (combat is a core part of Fabula Ultima after all), the real antagonist
appears later, often under the guise of an evil influence that has corrupted peaceful
creatures (see page 174).

CHAPTER
A CRUEL CURIOSITY
A lack of knowledge might spark a conflict, but seeking knowledge can take on
dangerous forms when not accompanied by empathy and respect: it is fated to become
a morbidly analytical pursuit.
This category include those “scientists” who demand answers and use any means
necessary to reach them – vivisectioning living creatures and putting whole
ecosystems under the microscope, destroying entire archaeological complexes and
ancient ruins, or stealing the ritual objects and cultural heritage of an entire people
just to catalog them in a university library or flaunt a collection.
In this regard, archaeology, botany and zoology are excellent starting points for a
natural fantasy conflict. Even better if a member of the group practices one of these
disciplines with both ethics and passion, or if they are a descendant of the culture
under scrutiny. It’s a great way to flip the usual fantasy stereotype that depicts ancient
ruins as completely detached from the current culture, promoting a false portrayal of
archaeological research and its social and environmental impact.
Example: at the center of Irkalla lake is a millennia-old city-island whose name none
remembers. Clattering constructs, protected by stone armor and animated by complex
magics, wander across its labyrinthine canals. Along the southern coast is a village,
inhabited by the descendants of the original builders: the local artisans adapted the
wind motors recovered among the ruins and the Council is gathering explorers to
discover the truth about their ancestors and the lights that appear over the lake during
the night. However, some want to collect the maze’s
treasures and sell them to the highest bidder,
and others have the dangerous wish to
see in action the miraculous weapons of
light mentioned in the Irkallans’ poems.
66
W
W
BEASTS AND MONSTERS
The protagonists of Fabula Ultima are positive, heroic figures, who fight against the
twisted ideologies and egotistic machination of the Villains. This premise is strictly
linked to the idea that the antagonists are aware and in control of their actions, even
when they don’t fully understand the consequences.
What happens when the antagonists are little more than animals or monstrous
creatures that, acting on instinct or according to their life cycle, threaten the region or
the protagonists’ community?
In such a case, it’s legitimate to question how “heroic” it is to fight creatures who are
just following their instincts or needs. The works that inspired this Atlas approach this
subject in a number of ways:
 Survival. This is the easiest approach, albeit a bit superficial and questionable, and it
simply reassures the Players that their actions are justified: in these settings, humans
are far less numerous than beasts and monsters, hence it’s sometimes necessary to
fight and kill them.
 Conservation. In this approach, a bit more complex and thoughtful, it is legitimate to
eliminate specific creatures that can cause massive damage to the entire ecosystem,
making those specific creatures play the role of Villains.
 Exorcism. This approach is based upon the idea of fighting only creatures that are
corrupted or infected by a magical influence or parasite, to purify them once they
are weakened (in Fabula Ultima one can choose the fate of an opponent reduced
to 0 Hit Points – death is not the rule). The source of such corruption is often an
environmental antagonist (see page 174).
 Revenge. In this variant of the previous approaches the heroes discover, often
through the ability to communicate with beasts, that the terrible fury or corrupting
influence was spawned from human atrocities, creating an age-old grudge that might
take the shape of a major (or even supreme) Villain… and to make matters worse, our
protagonists’ early actions might have contributed to such a disaster.
This Atlas cannot tell you which approach, or what relationship between humanity
and nature, you should adopt. This is something your group should decide together.
Nevertheless, remember that the nature of the struggle between humans and the
world is a precise thematic choice that should never be trivialized.

CHAPTER
SOMETHING BITTER OR MELANCHOLIC
Finally, all tense situations and conflict scenes in a natural fantasy campaign
should have a bitter or melancholic aftertaste, which highlights the torment of the
antagonists, the bonds between the heroes and those who are in danger, or reiterates
how the PCs are facing the consequences and paying the price of errors that were
committed by the people of the past.
Here are some examples:
To defeat the wrathful ice spirits, the Alderman’s daughter decided to wield an ancient
relic with the power to destroy souls. She too is going to forfeit her own, but the clan
will survive.
The majestic Jade-Horned Lion nourishes the region by cyclically dying and being
reborn; but his current incarnation became attached to a human orphan and rejected
death, ultimately turning into a monster.
A terrible disease strikes down settlements that surpass a certain technological level,
or that dig up and activate the Progenitors’ machines.
Cornered by the new fishing regulations, the people of a Player Character’s native
village accepted the thane’s money and allowed his men-at-arms to scour the
forbidden ruins under the village.
The heroes battle a beautiful and titanic plant monstrosity, contaminated by the
experiments of a careless apprentice witch. The seed was planted by a young hunter
to commemorate the death of his partner.
Crossing the Bone Steppe at night is very dangerous – following the steps of the
Warthog Goddess, whose wounds bleed continuously, the restless spirits of animals
killed by a now-forgotten Empire possess their own bones and assault the living.
Born from an egg that hatched centuries after the extinction of her species and
overwhelmed by desperation, the Magmamoth Queen devoured the ancient magic of
the forest, until she became a veritable living hive.
“I have no doubt that it is necessary.
I just wish I wasn’t the one to carry this burden.”

W
MAGIC AND RITUALS
In a natural fantasy campaign, magic is a field where the themes of balance,
coexistence, mistakes, and punishment emerge at their strongest. Moreover, the
relationship between humanity and supernatural creatures hinges on a few core
assumptions, discussed in the following pages.
MAGIC AS A NEGOTIATION
Magic represents the delicate relationship between humanity, the ecosystem, and the
mysteries of life itself: it’s important to ask what is the source of the magical powers
wielded by the characters and how such abilities might alter the existing balance.
The “Everything has a soul” pillar, from page 14 of the Core Rulebook, comes into its
highest expression in natural fantasy – magic is alive, often incarnate as a local spirit
or presence, and reacts according to its own will and personality.
Depending on which characters are involved in the campaign and what kind of threat
they face, this approach might express itself in many ways and should influence the
game mechanics. The following sections contain advice and considerations on how to
handle these themes, which require special attention.
9 SPIRITS, DEITIES, AND PRESENCES
“Divinity” isn’t something far away and limited to specific moments of prayer; it’s close,
everyday, and omnipresent, but also extraordinary, sentient, and unpredictable. It’s
part of everything on both an individual and universal level.
 Individual. Divine entities often appear as spirits or presences inhabiting a place,
object, or creature. Sometimes they manifest as elemental beings, other times as
demons born from a build-up of spiritual power or due to a creature’s extreme
longevity, or as a conglomerate of magical energy, lacking a conscience but still “alive”.
 Universal. Divinity as a concept also represent the global, cyclical and interconnected
totality of everything: a symphony of lives that are born, transformed and pass away,
feeding upon and influencing each other. This universal dimension of the divine often
appears in the guise of a spirit realm, permeating reality but visible only to a few.
We can say that magic draws power from a universal energy through an individual
medium, but in doing so it causes immediate reactions on the individual level and/or
long-term consequences on a universal scale.
W
69
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
9 FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE REACTIONS
Since both magic and the divine dwell in spirit form within places, items, and
creatures, the use of spells, Rituals, and magic abilities – and excluding Invokers
(see page 154) with their ability to harmonize with natural forces – might provoke
a reaction from those very same spirits. The details of such events vary based on the
character’s Identity and abilities used, but they often come into play as a consequence
of Opportunities, Fabula Points, Sacrifices, or failed Rituals. The Game Master might
also add favorable and unfavorable plot twists as they see fit.
Among the most fitting rules to use in these circumstances are harmful or beneficial
environmental effects (see Core Rulebook, page 299), a sudden shift in the invocation
wellsprings (see page 156) or, in the most extreme situations, the introduction of a
new threat or danger.
9 MEDIATION AND RITUALS
Following these premises, Rituals become a dialogue with the forces of nature
and require self-discipline, empathy and preparation – they are often the exclusive
prerogative of a single member of the group, trained in one or more disciplines:
 Chimerism, Elementalism, and Spiritism. These are the most common disciplines,
associated with communicating and negotiating with the spirits of flora and fauna,
the presences inhabiting the basic elements and the positive and negative influences
that flow through all living creatures, respectively.
 Arcanism. When reimagined to fit a natural fantasy style, this
discipline represents the ability to gain the favor of ancient
protector spirits, keeping a fragment of their power inside
any item they consider an appropriate vessel.
This may include being hosted within the
Arcanist’s own body, in the form of a tattoo,
scarification or partial metamorphosis.
 Entropism and Ritualism. Finally, these
disciplines are the most unusual and
they are linked to a subject we will
address in the following page: magic
as a form of control.
70
W
W
MAGIC AS CONTROL
If the magical arts represent a field defined by difficult compromise and negotiation
between humanity and supernatural powers, it’s just a matter of time before someone
tries to overstep these “limitations” and gain full control over these forces.
In natural fantasy worlds, magic is an allegory of life itself: the insidious desire to reject
or eliminate its most complex and mysterious aspects – so that it operates “on a human
scale”, following cold, predictable and standardized rules – sparked some of the most
terrible atrocities during ancient times.
Even in this case, some character options lend themselves more to this kind of magic,
unconcerned with the balance of the ecosystem, focused on reaching a result without
any regard for the consequences:
 Entropism. A complex discipline with unlimited potential, capable of manipulating
time and space, Entropism is perfect as the legacy of a distant epoch, when extremely
advanced civilizations made reckless mistakes for which the world is still paying the
price. More often than not, the protagonists that wield Entropism are androids or
experimental beings, awoken after millennia of stasis. It’s a kind of magic dramatically
out of place, a relic of a different time that brings with it a warning about a calamity
that might strike the world again.
 Ritualism. Precisely because of its relatively basic and approachable nature, this
discipline is often assimilated with an academic or rationalist mindset, divorced from
the spiritual implications and, in the end, reduced to a mere tool. If used in conjunction
with technological sciences it can reactivate ancient machinery to take full control
over the forces of nature or be used to unleash indiscriminate preemptive destruction
against any threat, be it real or perceived.
 Classes. It might be interesting to employ Classes such as Tinkerer, Merchant (see
page 158), Loremaster and Symbolist (see High Fantasy Atlas, page 146) to create
a character with a cold, utilitarian view of magic at first – over the course of the
campaign they will develop a more complex and nuanced perspective, recognizing
and confronting the idea that magic is a living force that they have to coexist with.
Finally, we have to spend a few words on the most common variations of these
concepts: deicide and fear of death.
71

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
9 DEICIDE
It might seem strange to so directly discuss the subject of killing a god, since Fabula
Ultima draws its inspiration from a long videogame tradition where the final opponent
is often a god-like entity with almost unlimited divine powers. However, in the natural
fantasy genre, this dynamic is often turned upside down: the destruction of a god
isn’t a rightful act of rebellion against a destiny that someone else already wrote,
but rather a violent, ignorant and selfish act, showing a lack of empathy toward the
spiritual world and driven by fear or greed.
Example: after ransacking the villages of the Great Taiga, the Shōgun didn’t find the
fabled iron mines he was looking for. However, his agents sighted a creature known
as Ōtetsuguma: a massive bear with metallic fur, who defeated scores of soldiers
and mercenaries sent to capture her. Bent on defeating this threat and bringing a
new trophy to his master, the Shōgun ignores the fact that the protector god of the
region lives inside the bear: if she is killed before finding a successor, she won’t be
able to awaken the spirits of flora and fauna in spring, condemning the Great Taiga to
a never-ending winter.
9 FEAR OF DEATH
One of the finest examples of the desire to control magic and nature is, without
any shadow of a doubt, the quest for immortality, which often drives the actions of
the main antagonist or is the foundation of one or more mysteries or threats. This
endeavor is as futile as it is reckless: denying the reality of death or attempting to
trick it and push it away, pollutes the cycle of life, causing spiritual stagnation and
unleashing upon the world a calamity that will snuff out future generations.
Example: ten thousand years ago, humanity fell victim to a fearsome epidemic. Fearing
extinction, scientists dismembered the ancient Kalpavriksha tree and developed a
synthetic forest to separate bodies and souls: instead of returning to the spiritual
stream of the planet, these souls were put in stasis inside the network, waiting for
it to birth a generation of clones, completely immune to the disease, to host them.
However, the research team grossly underestimated humanity’s knack for survival:
now, their descendants live in harmony with generations of clones discarded by the
system, who developed individual souls in the meantime. Trapped in their stasis, the
original souls became corrupted, making the resynchronization erratic and turning
them into malevolent shape-shifting spirits.
“He looked for immortality and it was granted to him.
He broke the peace and peace was forever taken from him.”

TECHNOLOGY
Contrary to what one might think, technology remains a core element of natural
fantasy campaigns, but it might assume very different roles depending on its function
in the setting.
MACHINES OF A FUTURE PAST
In the natural fantasy world, technology represents the endless possibilities of the
future and the quiet warnings of the past at the same time – this thematic tension
might become the hinge of a narrative arc for a character built upon the Tinkerer,
Merchant (see page 158) or Loremaster Classes.
Below you can find some advice and observations concerning this topic:
 Dangerous leaps. Recovering and studying technological relics from eras past offers
a chance to accelerate the development of a community or settlement, but doing so
without weighing the possible consequences might lead to a catastrophic outcome.
The message of natural fantasy stories isn’t that technology is inherently malicious,
but rather that its impact should be carefully evaluated: often, the wiser path to tread
is a slower and more careful development, because taking every possible shortcut
creates fertile ground for opportunists.
 Quest for coexistence. In line with the previous point, natural fantasy strongly
critiques the idea of technology as a “victory over nature”: even in a world where
humanity lives surrounded by dense forests and wild animals, looking to rule over
them rather than living in harmony means surrendering our hearts to despair. The
way to coexistence is seldom peaceful, but there is a noticeable difference between
protecting what you love and annihilating everything else.
 Tools of destruction and rebirth. In natural fantasy stories we frequently see
the rediscovery or reactivation of a machine, device, or generator that provides
extraordinary power… but also brought ruin upon its ancient creators. These
technologies have an ambivalent role: they are gifts from the past just as much as
they are its curse, and represent another chance, but if handled with arrogance or
haste they will lead to tragedy.
All these elements are great ways to spark a conflict, either between different factions
hell-bent on using technology in different ways, or between humans and the spirits
of nature. Thanks to their long lives, these spirits remember perfectly the disasters of
the past and consider the current humans to be as childish and irresponsible as their
ancestors, often to the point of choosing a preemptive strike. Of course, many would
consider these “unmotivated” attacks as another threat to eradicate.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
VEHICLES AND TRANSPORTS
Natural fantasy worlds are characterized by small or medium-sized settlements, dense
forests and winding paths. Travelers journey on foot or with mounts, carts, or small
boats. Flying vehicles and mounts are extremely rare, perhaps nonexistent. However,
sometimes the remains of ancient technologies are combined and adapted to create
ingenious rustic hybrids.
From a thematic perspective, traveling on foot is a slow but harmless choice, whereas
using mounts or vehicles might be an act of violence against nature, depending on
the character’s treatment of the animal or environment. The relationship between a
character and their Faithful Companion (see Core Rulebook, page 217) is an excellent
positive example, while destroying a forest to create a railroad is a classic example of
cruelty toward the ecosystem.
THE ROLE OF THE ARTISAN
The artisan is a very important figure in natural fantasy settings, and their social role can
be characterized as mostly technical, mostly spiritual, or a balanced mixture of the two.
 Technical role. In this sense, the artisan has the knowledge and abilities to shape
matter and create something new from it, giving form to an idea and finding
innovative solutions to many problems.
 Spiritual role. From a magical and ritualist perspective, the artisan has the gift to
mediate between the spirits and energies that inhabit matter, emphasizing their
unique properties in the final object.
These transformative roles are inextricably intertwined, but
some artisans focus more on one or the other.
Given their importance, the following
pages present an updated version of
the optional rules for materials and
forging, originally introduced with
the 2022 winter holidays bonus:
A Christmas Gift from Edgar!.
74
W
MATERIALS AND FORGING
This optional rule is especially fitting for natural fantasy stories, but it can be
integrated into any campaign without any modification.
It has four main goals:
 Define more precise guidelines for the value of materials than those provided in the
Core Rulebook.
 Extend the use of gathered materials to the creation of equipment, instead of limiting
it to selling, funding Projects or reducing the Mind Point cost of Rituals.
 Provide rules for characters that want to forge weapons, armor, shields and accessories.
The Project rules weren’t meant for this and they are quite unwieldy for blacksmiths,
weaponsmiths, stylists, goldsmiths and so on.
 Allow Game Masters to offer forging materials instead of complete items when giving
rewards, not only saving time and energy better spent on designing adversaries
and important items, but also providing a way to reward the Players even when the
narrative situation doesn’t lend itself to “classic” rewards such as rare items, Inventory
Points or money.
9 OBTAINING MATERIALS
The Core Rulebook already suggests that Game Masters include non-equipment
items among rewards (see pages 264–265); forging materials follow those same
rules and should be considered part of the session’s rewards. Each copy of a given
material is a single-use item and has a value assigned by the GM (ideally between
500 and 3000 zenit).
Example: four level 12 Player Characters have defeated a colossal insect. An
appropriate reward would amount to 1800 zenit in total, with no single item worth
more than 1000 zenit. Since the group already recovered an aegis gorgonis (800
zenit; see Core Rulebook, page 283) shortly before the battle, the Game Master offers
them a titan carapace (1000 zenit).
The Game Master is free to give materials any name and value, or use the table from
page 78 onward to randomly generate them. The important thing to remember is that
each material has to quite clearly inspire one or more possible uses.
W
75

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
9 PURCHASING MATERIALS
Characters may purchase any material available in their surroundings by spending an
amount of zenit equal to its value. When it comes to Projects, step 3 on page 134 of the
Core Rulebook abstracts this process but the group might prefer to purchase specific
materials and keep them for future use. The Game Master has the final say on which
materials can be bought in any given area, at which cost and in which quantity, but they
should involve Players who control characters from that region or have studied it, or who
play Classes like Tinkerer, Merchant (see page 158), Loremaster or Wayfarer.
9 SELLING MATERIALS
If there is an artisan, merchant or other potential buyer available, Player Characters
can usually sell materials at half their normal value in the same way as for normal
items (see Core Rulebook, page 124).
Continuing from the previous example: if the group ever decides to sell that titan
carapace they retrieved, they would earn 500 zenit.
On the other hand, using a material to cover the cost of a Project (see Core Rulebook,
page 137) or to forge items as described in the next page will let you use its full
value, showcasing its full potential.
These options involve PCs in the process of transformation, death and rebirth
typical of natural fantasy, but must not be used to reenact colonialist fantasies
or gratuitous cruelties towards animals and living beings.
 Harvesting the remains of a monster that threatened the village and using
them to protect it is very different from hunting for others of the same
species to hoard materials: finding resources should be a consequence of
the story events, not a goal (you can leave that to the Villains!).
 This system won’t suffer if you limit yourselves to inanimate materials such
as minerals, fluids, scraps, fallen branches or leftover chrysalises.
 When you create an item from the remains of a creature, strive to do so with
the required dignity, creating something that pays homage to their original
form, appearance, and nature..
ISSUES AND ALTERNATIVES
76
W
9 FORGING RARE ITEMS
This optional rule makes it possible to spend materials to create new accessories,
armor, shields, and weapons designed by the Players – as long as they meet at least
one of the following conditions:
 The group has access to an NPC artisan capable of creating the required item. For
example, a blacksmith for armor or a tailor for a dress.
 The group has access to an artifact or other magical or technological device that can
synthesize or transform objects.
 The group includes at least one Player Character with the Tinkerer Class or an
Identity that ties into a profession relevant to the item that they want to create. The
Game Master has the final say, but they shouldn’t be too restrictive.
The forging process described below usually requires a single rest; keep in mind
however that there is no limit to the number of items the group can forge during the
same rest, provided they have all the appropriate materials and enough zenit to pay
all the required artisans.
W OW
The group prepares a draft of the item they wish to create, using the rules in
the Core Rulebook (see page 266 onward). The item’s total cost in zenit must
be equal to or lower than【 the highest level among PCs, multiplied by 60】.
1
OW The Game Master decides whether the item has a cost appropriate to its effects
and whether the provided materials are fit for forging it.
3
OW The group also indicates which materials they will provide for forging it; their
total value must be equal to or higher than the cost of the item (if higher, the
materials will be completely expended anyway).
2
If the Game Master proposes any changes, go back to step 1.
OW
Once the Game Master approves the draft and proposed materials, the item can
be created. If this is done by an artisan NPC, they will require payment equal to
a tenth of the item’s total cost in zenit.

77
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
Since the design and approval process for each item might require a fairly long
conversation, it’s often a good idea to take care of forging during the downtime
between sessions. However, it’s important that the group is in a situation that lets
them rest between the end of a session and the start of the next (irrespective of
when you decided to play the corresponding rest scene).
Continuing from the previous example: the group wants to use the titan carapace
to craft a heavy weapon with the same profile as the beowulf (see Core Rulebook,
page 276), but capable of dealing air damage. The total cost is 660 zenit, well within
the limit of 720 zenit derived from the group’s level of 12. The Game Master has no
objections, so the item can be crafted by expending the material (worth 1000 zenit
– 340 are wasted) and paying 66 zenit to a local weaponsmith. The brynhild will be
ready in a few hours!
Going strictly by the numbers, this process is far less convenient than a standard ingame
reward, but it provides the group with the freedom to choose which item they
create and gain access to. Moreover, finding a true rare item, instead of a simple raw
material, becomes a very special moment, since its value will be slightly higher than
anything the group might forge on their own.
9 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER RULES
Like most optional rules tied to equipment, forging might raise a few questions. Here
is a list of answers to the most common ones:
 Custom Weapons. The group can take advantage of the forging rules to create any
kind of equipment, including custom weapons (see page 112). They just need to use
the base version of a custom weapon in the draft, instead of an item from the basic
equipment lists, and then apply the rules from page 266 of the Core Rulebook as usual.
 Technospheres. Weapons, armor and shields intended for technospheres (see Techno
Fantasy Atlas, page 130) follow the standard rules for forging, but the only Qualities
available are slots α, β, γ and δ.
 Pilot’s Modules. Weapon, armor and support modules (see Techno Fantasy Atlas,
page 160) can be forged using these rules. Keep in mind that the base version of
weapon and armor modules are worth about 500 zenit each (any modifications
increase their cost in the same way as for rare items), while support modules are
worth about 1000 zenit.

Playing Fabula Ultima in a natural fantasy setting is an excellent opportunity to
express your creativity and design pieces of equipment tied to folklore, exploration
and the protagonists’ personality.
This section contains tips to help you imagine and describe compelling natural fantasy
equipment, followed by a list of new rare items you can include in your campaign or
use as inspiration.
INGENUITY AND PERSONALITY
In natural fantasy worlds, every item tells a story, highlighting the ingenuity and the
craftsmanship of its creator, whether it’s a treasure from ages past or a trusty tool
for adventurers.
 Past and Present. In natural fantasy campaigns, contemporary equipment often
looks very down to earth and no-frills – not very memorable, perhaps, but solid and
reliable. On the other hand, more elaborate and unusual pieces of equipment are
often handed down from generation to generation, or retrieved from the depths of
mysterious ruins and adapted to new uses. Firearms often fall in the last category and
are a once-in-a-lifetime sight.
 Accessories of all kinds. Natural fantasy accessories can be divided into three main
categories: precious jewelry created with highly refined craftsmanship and symbolic
materials, like silver, iron, jade, bone, or the scales of a specific creature; lucky charms
and other personal creations; and finally, practical tools that the characters carry for
emergencies. This last category is of particular importance because of an underlying
message: even the most humble tool can become powerful in the hands of a hero
that deeply cares for it.
 Built with your own hands. One of the most distinctive design principles of natural
fantasy is the ingenious combination of ancient technologies and recycled materials,
such as repeating crossbows built with wood and bone, alchemical arquebuses,
steam-powered devices, and blades forged with unknown alloys or components
recovered from ancient constructs. These tools usually follow the standard profiles
included in the Core Rulebook, but the most complex and unlikely weapons might
require the custom weapon rules (see page 112).
In short, natural fantasy items should stand out for their practical appearance,
handmade quality, the ability to merge ancient technologies and recycled materials,
or reveal something about those who chose, created or gifted them.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
A STORY IN EVERY ITEM
When designing a rare item for a natural fantasy campaign, take some time to think
about the story it tells: what technique was required? What materials were used?
Which places or creatures did they come from?
One of the core themes of natural fantasy is transformation, which can also be
interpreted as the death or sacrifice of something in order for something else to exist.
From this point of view, a character’s equipment is a collection of stories, taken from
fragments of other beings’ lives and bodies.
The rules for creating rare items from materials (see page 76) offer an excellent
opportunity to dive deep into this concept over the course of the campaign.
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
Characters with animal or plant-like features are rather common in the natural fantasy
genre, and it might be interesting to create equipment tailor-made for them (perhaps
using the custom weapon rules; see page 112), or give their pieces of equipment an
unusual name and appearance.
Example: a spider-person using silk flails or elemental stingers; a flower fairy dressed
in petals; an anthropomorphic cactus whose caps and berets are actually custom
weapons that determine the profile of their needle spray.
HISTORICAL, FOLKLORIC, AND LITERARY REFERENCES
If you’re looking for a name for a natural fantasy item but you’re short on ideas,
you might draw inspiration from items and creatures from folklore and literature,
especially works tied to spirits, ghosts, or fairies, or you could pay homage to famous
scholars, warriors, artisans and explorers from the real world.
Example: Bai Suzhen, Boggart, Bradamante, Cervantes, Csoma, Da Vinci, Earhart,
Gentileschi, Grimm, Guðríðr, Gwyllion, Huolong, Kaguya, Oberon, Okiku, Qingzhao,
Rembrandt, Shahrazād, Shiranui, Tomoe, Vasilisa, Yoshizawa, Zaratan.
As usual, do your best to match each name with an item whose properties mirror the
historical and cultural inspiration, rather than misrepresent it.

ARTIFACTS
Natural fantasy campaigns boast a massive variety of artifacts. In line with the themes
of this genre, their value doesn’t necessarily stem from their power, but rather from
their cultural and sentimental value, as well as what they represent for those who
inherited them or received them as a gift.
VISIONS OF THE PAST
Natural fantasy artifacts are often very ancient and impossible to replicate in the
current era. They include clues about the epochs they came from and were often the
epicenter of terrible disasters and tragic mistakes that humanity barely remembers.
It’s very likely that, driven by ambition or necessity, we repeat the errors that these
artifacts were intended to warn us against, misinterpreting what little information is
available or reinterpreting it at our convenience.
INSTRUMENTS OF TRANSFORMATION
Some natural fantasy artifacts have the power to transform creatures, places and
objects. These can be divided between allegories of inevitable change (if the
transformation is spontaneous and uncontrolled) and temptations of control (if it can
be directed or manipulated). How people react to the presence of such artifacts is a
key aspect of natural fantasy storylines.
DYNAMIC ARTIFACTS
More often than not, natural fantasy artifacts present a dynamic evolution: not only
we discover more about their role, but the artifacts themselves become progressively
more powerful or take a new form, even in rule terms – they might become an ally or
a vehicle, grant a new Skill, or create a Villain.
RENUNCIATION, RESTITUTION AND CONSERVATION
Fabula Ultima often portrays artifacts as dangerous items that the heroes have to
find before the Villains do. However, natural fantasy artifacts tend to have a cultural
significance – they don’t belong in a museum, but rather, exactly where they are. The
heroes shouldn’t seek to replace Villains as the possessors of such items, but rather
ensure their restitution or that nobody takes them. Sometimes, this means renouncing
a great power and trusting that others will keep it safe in the PCs’ absence – after all,
humility, hope, and trust are core elements of natural fantasy protagonists.

CHAPTER
CARDINAL KYLIX
A large, shallow metal cup, freezing to the touch.
Legends tell of the Statue Civilization and their ability to extinguish any opposition
or rage from elemental forces, making them docile and predictable – a power that,
millennia ago, allowed them to build immense cities and create an unprecedented
civilization. In this age of unpredictable and destructive natural phenomena, some
regard that power as a source of hope and answers. Preserved in the hands of a
colossal statue at the bottom of the Northern Chasm, this artifact whispers promises
of control and safety, of a world where humanity will become master of land and sea.
There is only one question it cannot answer: what will humans do when they have
nothing to fear anymore, except each other?
EGG OF ILLUYANKA
A heavy and cumbersome egg with an extremely hard, striped shell.
Over the centuries, the mighty draconic creatures known as Illuyanka ruled over the
Cedar Forest, discouraging any attempt to build a permanent settlement. But with the
arrival of drought, the tribes of the plains formed an alliance, creating hunter cadres
to exterminate the already-scarce Illuyanka, and cut down the forest to create new
pastures. This egg is probably the last of its kind, preserved by the elven ascetics of the
Yellowcape Clan in anticipation of a threat that, according to their oral tradition, will
manifest when the egg hatches.
GEMSHORN OF TRANQUILITY
A flute carved from the horn of a cliffgoat.
When a cliffgoat reaches the end of their life and manages to serenely breathe their
last, one of their horns might fall off. Once collected and crafted by a skilled artisan,
the horn becomes a musical instrument with magical properties: if the flutist has
good intentions, their music soothes the fear and rage of beast, monster and plant
creatures (an effect equivalent to a Chimerism or Spiritism Ritual, but requiring
neither Mind Points nor a Magic Check; however, during a conflict, it still needs a full
Clock to activate).
90
W
HAVENBELL
A brass bell decorated with a red ribbon.
According to some folk tales, if you help a silkie in danger or show her great respect
and admiration, she might offer you a small decorated bell. Ringing it causes a house
to appear nearby. It will be rustic, but welcoming and secure and it’s protected by the
silkie herself, in the guise of a tall, stern fairy with sapphire-colored hair. You can rest
here in complete security but, at the end of the rest, you have to roll 1d6: with a 1 or 2,
the silkie makes a peculiar (often bizarre) request of you. If the request isn’t satisfied,
this artifact vanishes in a puff of leaves and dew.
KEYS OF THE HARMONIST
A large silver ring with nine keys of dull metal.
This artifact dates back to the time when the Harmonists undertook long journeys
across the southern plateau, spending months in service to the animal spirit that, in
turn, would reveal their name and give them part of their power. Today, the plateau is
an icy waste and the heavy keys that held the spirits’ favor are blackened and inert.
Still, if a group of brave and honest heroes were to follow the pilgrimage’s path,
showing their loyalty, that dormant power might be reawakened and the spirits could
fight alongside humans once again, in the guise of Arcana that can be summoned by
any member of the group (but not by two or more at once).
MOON MIRROR
A circular mirror of oxidized metal.
Found by one of the village’s founders in a very ancient tomb near the ocean, this
mirror appears to be made out of an unknown metal which reflects moonlight with
great intensity. At night, it allows the user to perform a Ritual as if they had acquired
the Verdant Sway Skill (see page 139), without paying the Mind Point cost. For this
Ritual to succeed, the mirror must be oriented to reflect moonlight toward the plant.
Sometimes, the reflected light causes vibrations and unpredictable movements in
machines and armor. What is its secret?

CHAPTER
REIDY’S JOURNAL
An old journal with thick pages, overflowing with notes.
Written by a young and brilliant scholar during his final days, this massive journal is a
rich anthology of legends, folklore and historical accounts.
Once per rest, the group may start a new search among its pages or continue a previous
one. The Game Master assigns a Clock to each piece of research (the more obscure the
information, the bigger the clock, from 4 to 10 sections) and Player Characters attempt
a Group Check with DL 10 to make any progress. Once a research Clock is full, the
Game Master provides a useful, reliable, and precise answer to the original question.
RESIN TEAR
A curved sword carved from gleaming amber.
Unable to even dent the armor of the ape-people of Iron Mountain, the warriors of
Oradh Kingdom felled the Thunder Forest’s trees, from youngest to oldest, sparing
none but the millennia-old yew tree near the waterfall. From its hardened resin,
boiling with sorrow, an Oradhan warrior carved a blade that could command lightning
(similar to an Elementalism Ritual, but costing no Mind Points). Wielding it, he
exterminated the ape-people and conquered their forge, whose secrets were stolen
and acted as foundation to Oradhan’s military tradition. Ever since that moment, the
spirits and beasts of land and sky are at war with the Oradh. The name of that warrior
was hidden, since his lineage is cursed.
SEAL OF THE SECOND SUN
A delicate cylindrical seal made of lapis lazuli.
The embossed inscription on this artifact recites, in high-imperial register: “In the
hands of the Winter Queen, a path opens to the new Sun”. Discovered by a young
explorer lost in the underground necropolis of Abarsa, this artifact caught the
attention of scholars and collectors, some drawing connections to the female statues
lining the perimeter of a stone tower in the southern archipelago, dating back to
the imperial age and the second ice age. A group of adventurers is organizing an
expedition to the tower but, despite their protests, they have been forbidden from
taking the cylinder with them.
92
W
SKULL OF THE SALAMANDER-GODDESS
A massive salamander skull with topaz teeth.
Stolen from the stone circle at the bottom of the valley of Three Volcanoes and
brought before the Governor by an ambitious merchant, this massive fossil is under
investigation by the Alchemists’ Guild, who are fascinated by its ability to emit heat
and fuel flames in close proximity. During these academic investigations, however,
the scholars ignored the legends about this artifact, which represent the earthly bond
of the elemental spirit that protects the Three Volcanoes – if the skull isn’t returned
before the coming summer, She-Who-Breaks-the-Earth will rise and, unable to find
her head, will roam across the world looking for it.
SKY OIL
A dense and viscous green liquid.
Having studied nature, the Ancients wished to rule it. Having ruled it, they wished
to create it. Having created it, they wished to improve it. This mysterious liquid,
which rains down from reddish clouds gathered over the ocean, is an extraordinary
elemental conductor and the prime result of its creators’ boundless ambition. This
artifact transforms all it touches, following inscrutable logics, compressing millennia
of evolution into mere hours and subjecting the victim to atrocious pain, as the
mutations observed in the aviocetae of the Coral Coast amply demonstrated.
THREE-KNOT ROPE
A thick rigging rope with three very tight knots.
Created in ancient times by the fishermen of the Mist Isle, these magical ropes
contained the essence of the wind in their knots. Undoing the first knot, you can
cast the Ventus spell (see Core Rulebook, page 189), ignoring its Mind Point cost;
undoing the second knot enables you to perform an Elementalism Ritual to control
the wind, ignoring its Mind Point cost; the third and final knot, rarely undone, grants
an audience with the Wind Princess herself. Only one Three-Knot Rope has survived
to the current day and the art of their creation was lost during the occupation of the
Mist Isle, currently reduced as a domain of the Dogado.

CHAPTER
TOME OF THE METEOR
A strange mechanism is encased in the cover of this heavy tome.
One of the most discussed books in the Academy’s library, this tome presents detailed
descriptions of improbable machines, alongside formulae and prayers to unknown
entities. Even the cover is a mystery: lodged inside the wooden panel is an extraordinary
clockwork device, with comet-shaped pointers moving at different speeds along a
calendar, whose dates and seasons have nothing to do with ours. Every self-respecting
scholar dismisses this artifact as a very elaborate joke, but the most honest admit that
they are a bit worried at the idea that the mechanism might stop someday.
UNDOVEN
A heavy metal contraption, similar to a portable oven.
A relic from a distant time, the Undoven closely resembles a massive portable oven
with a large front door. This artifact has the extraordinary ability to disassemble
any complex object into simple materials using heat. It can also self-recharge, but
this takes some time.
Once per rest, you can put any one piece of equipment (accessory, weapon, armor or
shield) in the Undoven to gain two different materials (see page 74) with a combined
value equal to that of the destroyed item. What would happen if you put another
artifact inside?
WHITE MASK FRAGMENT
The right half a horned wooden mask.
Some stories tell of how the sculptor Acaunissa lost her inspiration. During a dream, a
bat told her it was stuck at the bottom of Bone Valley and that only the Vulture King
could grant it back to her. Her father forbade Acaunissa from leaving, but she ignored
him and sculpted a white mask with two horns to trick the souls of the departed. When
she met the King, he told her the mask itself was proof her inspiration had never been
lost in the first place. After her return, Acaunissa’s father punished her by breaking the
mask, but the artist’s courage still permeates this fragment and no undead, except
Villains, may harm the one who wears it.
“Perhaps due to our ability to communicate,
we humans often deem our pain more significant
than the far quieter pain of other creatures.”

PROTAGONISTS
This chapter is dedicated to the creation and growth of natural fantasy Player
Characters – to take full advantage of its contents you have to pair it with the Press
Start chapter of the Core Rulebook (from page 145 onward). All options contained
here are designed to be compatible with those presented in other official Fabula
Ultima Atlases. When deciding which additional mechanics to include in your Fabula
Ultima campaigns, the whole group should consider what fits the narrative context
and the needs of all who participate – take good care of your play experience!
This chapter contains two main sections:
NATURAL FANTASY HEROES
Here you will find tips and suggestions for Players who are about to create a character
and play in a natural fantasy campaign, including several examples of PCs that make use
of the natural fantasy rules and options presented in the following pages.
NEW OPTIONS
Here you will find new rules and mechanics designed for natural fantasy PCs but
compatible with any Fabula Ultima campaign:
 Custom weapons. New rules to create unique and ingenious weapons.
 Natural Fantasy Quirks. New natural-fantasy-style mechanics that enrich and add
depth to your characters.
 Camp Activities. A new optional rule to add mechanical depth to resting scenes.
 New Classes. Four new Classes focused on processes of growth and discovery:
the prudent Floralist, the surprising Gourmet, the harmonious Invoker and the
dependable Merchant.
 New Heroic Skills. Twenty-one new Heroic Skills that augment the options found
within the Core Rulebook and provide power-ups and support for the new Classes
introduced in this Atlas.

W
NATURAL FANTASY HEROES
The main characters of natural fantasy campaigns are extremely varied, and often
seem indistinguishable from those found in high fantasy stories. However, we can still
identify a number of recurring elements that make them stand out.
In many ways, almost every natural fantasy Player Character can be described as the
“more restrained and less superheroic version” of another classic archetype from a
different Fabula Ultima campaign. The core theme is always the same: the natural
fantasy style starts from the same premises and key concepts outlined in the Core
Rulebook, but makes the story more compact, simple (not simplistic), and familiar.
BRAVERY AND INTROSPECTION
The natural fantasy style ties in strongly with ideas like the rediscovery of the past
and the ability to coexist with the environment without suppressing it, but at the
same time without letting ourselves be crushed by it. Of course, these elements are
also a key part of our protagonists.
 Many questions. Even the quietest and most contemplative of natural fantasy
characters is actually curious, often fascinated by the mysteries of the past and the
wide world beyond the boundaries of their town or village. Of course, some of these
heroes are timid or insecure, but in the recesses of their souls burn a craving for
adventure and a fascination with mythology, legends and tales of people and places
far away in time and space.
 Compassionate souls. Natural fantasy heroes often put themselves in someone else’s
shoes, empathizing with others and being deeply affected by their suffering. Some
might play the tough guy or appear cold because they were hurt one time too many,
but this facade should crack over the course of the campaign, eventually crumbling
once they face a situation that reopens old wounds.
 A steady heart. Despite living in an often dangerous and incomprehensible world,
surrounded by a metaphorical and literal “dark forest”, these characters rally tightly
together, finding strength to overcome fear and doubt in their fellow travelers.
 Ready to take a step back. While possessing all these qualities, natural fantasy
heroes don’t demonstrate them all the time and are far from perfect – in fact, it is
key to the development of the campaign that Players have their characters make
mistakes and be forced to reckon with their own ignorance. This creates a chance
for them to reevaluate themselves and others, rather than seek refuge within pride
and fear. After all, seeking the truth means accepting that said truth might be painful.

CHAPTER
A DYNAMIC BALANCE
The various elements described in the previous page lead to a single, pivotal idea:
balance. By this we don’t mean a static or artificial balance, a combination of order,
immobility, and predictability, but rather the constantly shifting balance of nature,
made of mistakes, joy, pain, regrets, and events both large and small, forming an
interconnected network so vast that nobody can truly glimpse all its nuances. Being a
natural fantasy hero means becoming an active and aware part of this cycle, protecting
it from those who want to control or interrupt it out of fear.
FRIENDS AND FAMILY
In many campaigns of Fabula Ultima, the protagonists’ friends and families fade
into the background or aren’t even mentioned unless they are key characters in the
setting or, as is so very often the case, potential Villains. During a natural fantasy game,
however, it’s a good idea to break away from this habit:
 Recurring NPCs. This option is ideal for campaigns that take place in a relatively
small region: some NPCs might be childhood friends, relatives, or mentors to the
protagonists. We should also see their evolution over the course of the story, without
necessarily turning them into allies or antagonists.
 Bonds within the group. If the majority of the PCs come from the same community, it’s
an excellent idea to represent their relationship using the Starting Bonds optional
rule (see Core Rulebook, page 220). We recommend that you use negative as well as
positive Bonds, to create more opportunities for character growth.
You can also establish that two or more Player Characters come from the same family,
but if you do, make sure this relationship doesn’t mirror real life too closely and that
it doesn’t create discomfort at the table.
SAMPLE NATURAL FANTASY CHARACTERS
The following pages provide profiles for ten Player Characters designed for natural
fantasy contexts. In contrast to the new Classic Characters (see page 134), these
examples focus on the thematic construction of the heroes and provide some tips on
how to grow these characters and their role in the story.
All characters in the following pages use the optional rules for Quirks (see page 120)
and some have Custom Weapons (see page 112).

AKELARRE
BASIC INFORMATION
AKELARRE IN DETAIL
Identity: Clumsy
Janara Apprentice
Theme: Doubt
Origin: Creektown
Quirk: Flight
Signature weapons: Magic
pumpkins
 Trained by Janara witches in the magical art since the age of seven,
Akelarre abandoned his birth name and decided to dedicate his entire
being to honoring the memory of his mentor, Hilda, who mysteriously
disappeared during her pilgrimage to the remote Willow Island: a
journey that, at the time, the young apprentice was considered too
inexperienced to undertake.
 Although Hilda was a very forgiving mentor and extraordinarily
talented in magic (or rather, because of that!), Akelarre is plagued
by Doubt and afraid that he will never measure up to her, so he still
lives in her shadow.
 Akelarre’s Classes are Floralist, Elementalist and Wayfarer. Together
with the rest of the group, the Player repurposed the Flight Quirk to
represent his flying broom, a gift from Hilda.
 During the campaign, Akelarre’s Player should be the go-to person
regarding witchcraft traditions and legends about Willow Island.
 Akelarre’s journey will deal with his insecurities and need for
validation; his fellow travelers will play a pivotal role in helping him
(or putting him to the test).

APSU
BASIC INFORMATION
APSU IN DETAIL
Identity: Waterfiend Hunter
Theme: Hope
Origin: Salt Hill
Quirk: Cursed
Signature weapons: Short
swords
 The bards sing of another age, when humans waged war against the
sea, using their machines to poison it. Since then, those who are born
with blue hair are Cursed by the Old Woman of the Tide, scorned by the
earth, and hounded by the ocean: their blood is saltwater.
 Able to see waterfiends due to his curse, Apsu earned his livelihood by
catching and killing them, to extract drinking water from the remains.
This brutal life was interrupted when he met an old oracle on the way
to Ocean’s Mirror to negotiate a truce with the Old Woman of the Tide
or, if necessary, kill her.
 Apsu is an Elementalist, Wayfarer and Weaponmaster, who uses
Spellblade to cast powerful spells such as Thunderbolt, through
his shortswords.
 The Game Master should involve Apsu’s Player in establishing any
information about the curse of blue hair and the water spirits, especially
the most dangerous and aggressive ones.
 Although his background and skill suggest a story of pain and violence,
Apsu is an optimist who strives to see the silver lining in all things – his
Hope theme makes him a real touchstone for the entire group.

DONNA MAXWELL
BASIC INFORMATION
DONNA IN DETAIL
Identity: Spark-spirit Huntress
Theme: Guilt
Origin: Illwind
Quirk: Ancient Weapon
Signature weapons: Seismic
revolver
 Three years ago, a research team led by Donna Maxwell left the fortified
citadel of Illwind for the ruins of the Celestial Labyrinth. Driven by
arrogant curiosity, these scholars activated the ancestral mechanism
which the Scripture calls the Matrix of Days, thereby freeing the Sparkspirit
trapped in its engine and causing the destruction of Illwind.
 Armed with a seismic revolver found in the Labyrinth, Donna swore
to find and kill the Spark-spirit before it could unleash its fury once
more. She considers herself Guilty of making a disastrous mistake,
and she isn’t wrong.
 Donna’s Classes are Loremaster, Sharpshooter and Tinkerer. She
uses a variety of infusions and capitalizes on her Insight thanks to
Knowledge is Power.
 Donna’s Player should be the go-to person for everything related to
Illwind and its researchers, not to mention the Celestial Labyrinth and
the dreadful wonders it hides.
 Donna’s revolver is a powerful weapon that targets Magic Defense and
deals 5 extra damage to elementals (a Quality valued at around 900
zenit), but it reacts unpredictably when near ancient machines and the
ruins scattered across the entire region.

LADY UNDERSSON IN DETAIL
Identity: Kind Android
Without Memory
Theme: Belonging
Origin: Ancient Ruins
Quirk: Underchild
Signature weapons: Clockwork
keys
 When the villagers found her, Lady Undersson was standing still, in
absolute silence, in front of the evergreen tree next to the entrance
of the ancient ruins. Devoid of any memory regarding her previous
function, the android decided to help the villagers in their everyday
chores, overcoming their initial hesitation due to their past experiences
with machines from underground.
 Despite her desire to become part of the village community, Lady
Undersson is plagued by short, fragmented visions of a hazy past
that she cannot escape, and the looming feeling that she forgot
something terrible.
 Lady Undersson is an Entropist and a Spiritist, who uses clockwork
keys (see page 116) as her weapon of choice.
 The Game Master should consult with Lady Undersson’s Player for
details regarding ruins and ancient machines.
 Over the course of the game, the Underchild Quirk allows Lady
Undersson’s memories to become clearer and clearer until she
remembers key information about a looming threat. It’s essential that
this moment establishes once and for all a bond of trust between this
PC and the rest of the group.

LAURENCE
BASIC INFORMATION
LAURENCE IN DETAIL
Identity: Chef and
Former Hunter
Theme: Mercy
Origin: Village of Arca
Quirk: Big Bro
Signature weapons: Sword and
shield
 When Laurence was just an apprentice hunter, his squad cornered
a powerful and regal wyvern in its lair and killed it. However, when
the captain, who Laurence saw as his adoptive mother, went in and
exterminated the entire brood, something in his soul snapped and he
swore never to kill again.
 Recently, a mysterious force has been pushing beasts and monsters to
attack human settlements, destroying vehicles, structures, and machinery
with unprecedented ferocity. Laurence volunteered to accompany a team
of heroes to discover what has caused such resentment.
 Laurence is a Gourmet, Guardian and Weaponmaster. His Big Bro Quirk
makes him excel at supporting the entire group.
 The Game Master should consult Laurence’s Player when describing
wild beasts and their habits, not to mention the tactics employed by
the hunters of Arca.
 Due to his oath, Laurence was mocked and shunned by the hunters of
Arca, and his old captain considers him her greatest disappointment. It’s
up to the other Player Characters to help him when mentor and pupil
inevitably clash again.

MELISSA HOLTZ
BASIC INFORMATION
MELISSA IN DETAIL
Identity: Exuberant Alchemist
Theme: Ambition
Origin: Eiche
Quirk: Traveling Workshop
Signature weapons: Alchemical
scepters
 In spite of her parents’ doubts, young Melissa worked hard and traveled
far to discover the secret of alchemy, with the Ambition of attaining an
official license and, upon her eventual return, bringing prosperity to the
mountain hamlet of Eiche.
 Melissa saved her money to buy a cart, pulled by a mighty and loving
auroch. This traveling workshop is full of mementos, notes and
unusual ingredients.
 Melissa combines Gourmet, Spiritist and Sharpshooter: together with
the rest of the group she adapted the Gourmet’s rules to represent
alchemy, using five seasonal essences instead of tastes. Her alchemical
scepters are custom arcane ranged weapons that she uses to fire her
compounds, creating expanding clouds using Barrage.
 Taking inspiration from the wu xing’s Late Summer, Melissa’s Player and
the rest of the group decided to add a fifth season to their setting, the
Calm, which has its own seasonal essence and is a time of transition for
the entire world when the elements coexist and combine in ways that
are, so far, poorly understood.
 Melissa’s personal goals are rather simple, but the mystery of the Calm
should have a deep influence on the story: of course, one or more
Villains have plans for it.

MYLO ULVE
BASIC INFORMATION
MYLO IN DETAIL
Identity: Gentleman
Archaeologist
Theme: Justice
Origin: Zentralia
Quirk: Mysterious Grimoire
Signature weapons: Elemental
rings
 An archaeology graduate from the Golden College, Mylo Ulve left the
capital when the Senate closed the faculty and sold all exhibits to
collectors to bankroll a new expansionist campaign to the West. Mylo
was able to save only the Codex Rubrum, an extraordinary magical
tome that, sometimes, answers the reader’s question in the language
of the ancient civilization of Escria.
 The information in the Codex supports the College’s theories about
Escria and the magical prowess of its Scribe-Priests, not to mention
its downfall at the hands of the founders of Zentralia. Even more
importantly, they completely invalidate the propaganda which presents
the current aristocracy as scions of the glorious Escria.
 Mylo’s Classes are Lormaster, Tinker and Wayfarer. He uses Alchemy
and potions and is one among the very few Zentralians that understand
the language of Escria.
 Mylo’s Player should be the go-to person for everything related to the
history of Zentralia and the fall of Escria (unless the group includes a
descendant of the Escrians, of course).
 As a character, Mylo adds two goals to the campaign: uncover the truth
about the Codex Rubrum and Escria, and oppose the Zentralian nobles
who crave the ancient magic of the Scribes.

OCTAVIA POLPI
BASIC INFORMATION
OCTAVIA IN DETAIL
Identity: Proud Ocean Merchant
Theme: Rebellion
Origin: Yonaguni
Quirk: Stubborn Scion
Signature weapons: Reinforced
pipe
 The youngest offspring of the Polpi merchant clan, Octavia is a young
oceanid, whose stubbornness and cutting humor hide a heart of gold.
This is why she rebelled against her own family and their way of
conducting business and decided to travel the surface world, building
a commerce and communication network that takes into consideration
the needs of the locals – and beating her relatives to it.
 Octavia is always accompanied by two tireless bodyguards, Crabecca
and Breamthony, who love her very much. Breamthony shares some
of her opinions about the rest of her family, while Crabecca is just
worried for her.
 Octavia’s shrewdness is well represented by her Merchant and Orator
Classes, and in case of emergency she can deal substantial blows with
her reinforced pipe (which uses the staff profile).
 Octavia’s Player should provide information about the Polpi clan,
the oceanids and the underwater territory of Yonaguni, in particular
regarding what kind of transportation is available for the surfacedwellers
that want to visit it.
 At the start of the campaign, Octavia is driven by her need for Rebellion,
but over the course of the game she should realize the true nature of
her feelings and become more mature.

RUAIRI
BASIC INFORMATION
RUAIRI IN DETAIL
Identity: Moth Court Outcast
Theme: Solitude
Origin: Hawthorn Forest
Quirk: Outcast Fairy
Signature weapons: Floral
greatswords
 Once upon a time, Ruairi was a noble warrior of the Moth Court, but
he was exiled because of his love for the Raven Witch, Baobhan Sith.
He wandered alone for centuries, only to eventually stumble upon
the tomb of his soulmate. There, he fell into a deep slumber, until
the arrival of a group of heroes with more enthusiasm than common
sense roused him from sleep.
 Despite how much time has passed, Ruairi is still an exceptional
fighter and many fairies remember his name; however, the relationship
between humanity and the fairy realm has soured significantly, and
both sides now look at him with suspicion.
 Ruairi wields a floral greatsword and combines the abilities of Floralist
and Darkblade, in a contrasting image of fragile beauty and visceral
sorrow. True to faefolk tradition, iron is his weakness.
 The Game Master should often consult Ruairi’s Player about all things
related to the fairies’ society, tradition, and powers.
 Ruairi doesn’t like to talk about it, but fairies cannot die unless killed,
and such must have been Baobhan Sith’s fate. One day, he’s going
to discover who was responsible and, on that day, he might swear
Vengeance or perhaps even turn into a Villain.

TSUKIHIME
BASIC INFORMATION
TSUKIHIME IN DETAIL
Identity: Incarnation of the
Moon God
Theme: Duty
Origin: Second Moon
Quirk: The Long Dream
Signature weapons: Bows
 According to legend, when a grave danger looms over the Land of
Elms and the Second Moon shines blue, the Moon God incarnates
in the world with the shooting of an arrow. This time, the guardian
is a young woman of elegant bearing and brave heart, albeit a bit
stubborn. The Priestess named her Tsukihime, or Moon Princess.
 Tsukihime’s Duty is to quell the restless spirits and purify the springs
of the four rivers that cross the region. The task will prove much
bigger than expected, and she cannot do it alone.
 The moon’s favor grants Tsukihime a special affinity toward nature –
her Classes are Chimerist, Invoker and Sharpshooter.
 Tsukihime’s Player should be the go-to person for everything related
to the Moon God, the Second Moon and the spirit world. At the same
time, the Princess’ knowledge of human society is extremely limited
and, above all, outdated.
 Every incarnation of the Moon God is destined to return to the stars
once their purpose is fulfilled. Hence, it’s essential that Tsukihime and
the rest of the group develop strong emotional bonds over the course
of the campaign. Perhaps these bonds will be powerful enough to
prevent a painful farewell.

From here on, the chapter focuses on new options and rules designed to enhance the
natural fantasy vibes of your Fabula Ultima campaign. However, if the whole group
agrees, you can use these options for any campaign.
These introductory pages provide preliminary information about the various options,
in terms of both mechanics and play experience, to help you identify the most
interesting ones for your game.
CUSTOM WEAPONS
You can use this rule to create unusual weapons. It’s a simple and
straightforward option with no profound gameplay implications – you can
always leave it open to anyone who is interested.
NATURAL FANTASY QUIRKS
This option is more complex and has a significant effect on character
creation. If you use it, each Player Character gains a set of unique
mechanics defining their abilities and role in the story.
These effects are powerful, ranging from the ability to ignore Mind
Point costs to brandishing a rare and ancient weapon.
Use Quirks if you and your group are comfortable setting
aside the power balance between characters in favor
of strong characterization. This option works best
in tight and collaborative groups and may be too
complex if this is your first experience with the game.

CAMP ACTIVITIES
This new optional rule allows the group to put more emphasis on resting scenes –
rather than just a simple narrative interlude used to create a new Bond or modify
existing ones, they become a way to provide special benefits to the entire group or
to specific allies.
In and of itself, this is a simple rule, but it adds a tangible benefit to the rest scenes
which allows the group to showcase the personality and nature of each character.
If you use this option, resting scenes will take a larger part of each session,
on average, and you will need to keep track of which Activities have
already been used and what their benefits are (these are often single-use).
NEW CLASSIC CHARACTERS
These sample natural fantasy builds expand on those provided in the Core Rulebook
(see page 172), expressing the full potential of this Atlas’ new Classes. You will also
find two premade Groups to draw inspiration from – one features characters sharing a
common Class, the other with greater variety.
NEW CLASSES
The Natural Fantasy Atlas introduces four new Classes for Player Characters. They
are designed to interact normally with those found in the Core Rulebook and other
expansions without any modifications. The following pages contain some practical
tips for Players and Game Masters to get the most out of these new Classes.
NEW HEROIC SKILLS
This last, lengthy section contains twenty-one new Heroic Skills. Some are tied to
the new Classes introduced by this Atlas, but most add options for those found in
the Core Rulebook.
“I’ve never seen a flower like this.
I wonder what its properties are!”

FLORALIST
 Floralists shine both for the variety of effects they can unleash, and their efficiency
– for all intents and purposes, the magiseeds are “automatic” secondary actions in
addition to the character’s regular action. That being said, this Class requires good
timing, because planting a magiseed one turn too late means wasting its potential.
 Although the Floralist’s baseline aesthetic is tied to seeds and plants, you can use this
Class to represent any character that can summon temporary little helpers. You can go
for a few simple cosmetic changes (algae, mushrooms, corals, etc.), or you could choose
something like clockwork turrets, support drones or even familiars, sprites or imps!
 Usually, a Floralist’s abilities go way beyond those of a common gardener or botanist,
and the Player should have final say when establishing any element of the setting tied
to plants, forests, plant-related creatures, and enemies belonging to the plant Species.
GOURMET
 This is a very peculiar Class, designed to mimic the experience of exploring and
combining items in a videogame by trial and error, without being able to consult
a precise guide. Its key feature is procedural gameplay. Every Gourmet is different
from the last, despite using the same five flavors: in order to discover which role
the character will play in the group, you must first and foremost play them.
 The Gourmet’s rules are based upon flavors, rather than specific ingredients. This
makes it easy to use this Class to represent other specialists (like brewers, mixologists,
confectioners or sushi chefs). You can also create strictly vegetarian or vegan
menus. You may also adapt these rules to represent any character who combines
materials or ingredients to create special effects, be they a chemist, an alchemist or a
pyrotechnician – you only have to define five ingredient types, and voila!
 The preparation, presentation and consumption of food are pivotal elements of each
and every culture, and embody the themes of transformation and interdependence
that are the beating heart of the natural fantasy style. If your group includes a
Gourmet, take your time to describe the most unusual delicacies, but also to reflect
upon the deep implications of ending one life to feed another.

CHAPTER
INVOKER
 Inspired by the geomancer archetype presented in some JRPGs, the Invoker never has
access to their full range of abilities – instead, their invocations are based upon the
elemental wellsprings available on the scene. To compensate, their cost in Mind Points
is low and their effects are quite strong… not to mention the possibility of enhancing
various kinds of damage with “Hex” invocations.
 The Ripples Skill is very powerful, but requires a synergy with at least one other member of
the group who is able to capitalize upon the different types of damage: the obvious choice
is an Elementalist, but Chanters, Dancers (see High Fantasy Atlas, page 136 and 142) and
Espers (see Techno Fantasy Atlas, page 150) are not far behind.
 Far from being a mere gameplay rule, the fact Invokers don’t impose themselves upon
the environment but rather adapt to it is a powerful thematic choice. It also creates a
contrast with Elementalists, who have to spend vast amounts of Mind Points to reliably
access whatever damage type they require. This tension, as well as the role of elemental
creatures and the relationship between magical arts and ecology, are very interesting
parts of the setting to explore.
MERCHANT
 Although more compact than the previous three Classes, the Merchant shouldn’t be
underestimated: Winds of Trade lets you introduce new NPCs and gives you access
to the right tool at the right time, while the other Skills form an impressive support
arsenal, especially for characters who heavily rely on Inventory Points, such as
Tinkerers and Symbolists (see High Fantasy Atlas, page 146).
 A cornerstone of the Merchant is that it doesn’t focus on accumulating money,
as shown by the Real Treasure Skill. The heroic nature of this Class hinges upon
communication, contacts, and helping exchanges between distant people. It’s a quest
for richness and prosperity, but in a human, cultural and communal sense.
 Merchants are curious, perceptive and very attentive individuals: some have traveled
far and wide, others have accrued knowledge of every sort over the course of many
negotiations, meetings and encounters. A Merchant’s Player should be involved in
establishing setting elements such as trade routes, roads, relationships between
people, and key resources, not to mention matters of etiquette, such as what would
be the most fitting gift to present to a prominent public figure.
“You must be strong, yes! But also humble, and kind.
There is no other way for a better world.”

W
The majority of JRPG protagonists wield unique weapons that reflect their style and
are an expression of their personality – from battle umbrellas to gun axes, nothing
should be considered too impractical!
The following rules allow you to create a custom weapon for your hero during
character creation. Later on, the Game Master can create rare versions of these
weapons as per the normal rules in the Core Rulebook (see page 268). You can find
sample rare custom weapons in the following pages.
Custom weapons aren’t necessarily better than normal basic weapons – choose what
to use based on what fits your personal vision of the character.
CREATING A CUSTOM WEAPON
A custom weapon starts with the following characteristics:
 It belongs to one Category of your choice (arcane, bow, brawling, dagger, firearm,
flail, heavy, spear, sword or thrown).
 It is not a martial weapon (E), but might become one depending on the
customizations that are chosen for it (see below).
 It is a two-handed weapon and cannot benefit from the Monkey Grip Heroic Skill
(see Core Rulebook, page 238); in short, a custom weapon will always occupy both
hand slots.
 It is a melee weapon or a ranged weapon (your choice, and regardless of the Category
you previously chose for it).
 It has a cost of 300 zenit.
 Its Accuracy Check relies on【 DEX + INS】 o【r DEX + MIG】 (your choice).
 It deals physical damage equal to【 HR + 5】.
A custom weapon also receives three customizations from the list on the right.
 Each customization can only be chosen once for each custom weapon.
 Choosing a customization marked with E turns the weapon into a martial weapon.
 If a customization says “you”, it refers to the character who has the weapon equipped.
 Some especially powerful customizations count as two customizations or increase
the cost of the custom weapon.

CHAPTER
CUSTOMIZATIONS
Accurate
Adds a +2 bonus to the weapon’s Accuracy Check formula.
Defense Boost
You gain a +2 bonus to Defense, and you are treated as having a shield equipped
for the sake of your Skills (for instance, Defensive Mastery or Dodge – see Core
Rulebook, pages 197 and 203).
Elemental
Choose air, bolt, dark, earth, fire, ice, light or poison. The weapon now deals damage
of the chosen type instead of physical, and also deals 2 extra damage.
Magic Defense Boost E
You gain a +2 bonus to Magic Defense.
Powerful E
The weapon deals 5 extra damage, or 7 extra damage if it is a heavy weapon.
This customization is not available for arcane and dagger weapons, or for weapons
with the quick customization (see below).
Quick (counts as two customizations) E
When you perform the Attack action and choose to attack with this weapon, you may
perform two attacks (against the same target or against different targets). If you do,
both attacks follow the rules for two-weapon fighting (see Core Rulebook, page 69).
Transforming (increases the custom weapon’s cost by 100 zenit)
This weapon has a second form, which must be designed as a separate custom weapon,
must have the transforming customization, and doesn’t cost you any zenit.
While you have one of the two forms equipped, you can equip the other form whenever
you want. During a conflict scene, you can only do so during your turn, while no other
effect is being resolved, and only once per turn.
If one or both the forms are martial (E), remember that you must have the appropriate
Classes to equip them. Additionally, a transforming weapon can still only have one
Quality (the Quality applies to both forms).
114
W
COMPATIBILITY
Custom weapons allow you to create the most bizarre armaments you can imagine,
but at the same time, efforts have been made to keep them somewhat balanced. For
instance, one might argue that a quick and accurate custom weapon is always better
than a pair of steel daggers, but there is a loss in flexibility because you can’t combine
that custom weapon with a different weapon – there’s pros and cons to each choice.
TRANSFORMING WEAPONS
The transforming customization is by far the most complex option provided by custom
weapons. One important note, however: if one form of your weapon is a melee weapon
and the other is a ranged weapon, or if they belong to different Categories, you only
gain the benefits of one form at a time.
For instance, if you use a weapon with a melee form and a ranged form, you won’t be
able to add both Powerful Shot and Powerful Strike to damage, or to Counterattack
while simultaneously having Crossfire available.
A character wielding a transforming weapon is always free to decide which form they
start with at the beginning of a conflict.
SAMPLE NATURAL FANTASY CUSTOM WEAPONS
The following pages showcase a few examples of natural fantasy-style custom
weapons, accompanied by possible rare evolutions. The following conditions apply:
 You may never wield a custom weapon in a single hand, not even decreasing its
damage by 4 as indicated on page 268 of the Core Rulebook.
 When it comes to transforming weapons, any modification (extra damage, Qualities,
Accuracy bonuses etc.) is automatically applied to both forms.
Sometimes, a Player Character’s custom weapon will have narrative weight (such as if
it was obtained via the Ancient Weapon Quirk, on page 121). In that case, it can be a
good idea to describe later rare variants as “upgrades” of the initial weapon, instead of
completely different items (for instance, they might be described as ribbons attached
to the hilt of a sword, or arrows with unique properties for a bow). However, the rules
and mechanics that govern items and equipment should not be altered.

Quirks are an advanced optional rule that provides strong thematic and mechanical
options for Player Characters. The Quirks presented in these pages were written with
a Natural Fantasy assumption, but may be used in any campaign; you may also use
them as reference to create your own Quirks - but you should only use those if the rest
of your group agrees to it.
 A Player Character may only ever have one Quirk.
 If you use Quirks in your game, it is strongly suggested that each Player Character
begins play with one; additionally, no two characters in the same group should
have identical Quirks.
 On average, a group of Player Characters with access to Quirks will be able to
tackle more challenging situations than what would be normal for their level.
 If it makes sense in the story, a character may lose their current Quirk and gain a
different one - discuss this with the group.
USING QUIRKS IN YOUR GAME
Quirks should be seen as a mechanical and narrative reinforcement of your characters’
unique nature. Keep the following in mind:
 Quirks shape the game. Even the less impactful Quirk is a powerful statement about
your character and their role in the story. If you pick Ancient Weapon, that item will
surely have narrative implications; if you go with The Long Dream, you are inviting
the Game Master to create situations in which you’ll be pressed to use your powers.
Quirks will take the already heroic Player Characters and kick them up a notch, which
can prove a bit overwhelming. Think carefully before you use them!
 Freedom of choice. You don’t need a Quirk for your character concept to be valid.
If your Identity is “Barkville’s Firstborn”, you shouldn’t feel forced to pick Stubborn
Scion for that Identity to be relevant to the story.
 What you should use Quirks for: bringing interesting situations into play, giving your
character unique issues to confront, providing additional mechanical support to your
character’s Traits.
 What you should never use Quirks for: making your character stronger than the
rest of the group, stealing the spotlight, bringing sensitive topics that make others
uncomfortable into play.

CHAPTER
9 ANCIENT WEAPON
You don’t fear delving deep in the ancient ruins; from their cold tunnels you have
retrieved an unusual weapon, which saved your life in more than one occasion. Where
did you find it? When did you stumble upon a similar weapon, and who carried it?
Together with the rest of your group, create a rare custom weapon (see page 112)
worth 1200 zenit or less.
This weapon should have an especially unusual and technological appearance; it can
be a good idea to make it a firearm weapon and determine that similar items are rare
and mysterious in your world.
Once per session (approximately four hours of play), the Game Master may give you
1 Fabula Point in order to have sudden complications arise due to the unique nature
of the weapon (such as strange machines reacting to its presence, or monsters drawn
to the special energy it emits). However, the weapon cannot be destroyed, damaged,
lost or stolen without your permission as a Player.
9 ARBOREAL
You are a sentient plant creature, with humanoid intelligence. Do you belong to a
particular species, or are you one of a kind? How does your life cycle function? Do you
resemble a specific type of plant, flower, or tree?
Choose a status effect: dazed, enraged, or shaken. You are immune to the chosen
status effect. However, you also become Vulnerable to a damage type of your choice:
air, bolt, earth, fire, or ice.
You also learn one NPC spell (pages 310-311 of the Core Rulebook; you cannot
choose Devastation; if a Magic Check is required, use【 INS + WLP】): customize the
spell as needed (name, damage type, status effects etc.). When you cast this spell while
in sunlight, its total MP cost is reduced by 5 (to a minimum of 0 Mind Points).

9 BIG BRO
Your travel companions know they can rely on you when it’s time to make camp and
catch a precious breath among the constant pressure of your adventure. Who taught
you to care for others? Is there anyone among the other Player Characters you see as
a younger brother or sister? What special promise did you make them?
If your group’s campaign does not make use of the optional rule Camp Activities (see
page 130), your character still gains access to it.
Your character gains access to three Camp Activities instead of only two.
If your character gains this Quirk during a campaign that already makes use of Camp
Activities, you simply gain access to a single new Camp Activity of your choice.
When you choose to perform Camp Activities during a Rest, choose one option: you
perform two different Camp Activities, whose effects cannot be applied to the same
creature; or you perform the same Camp Activity twice, applying its effects to two
different creatures.
9 CURSED
You bear the burden of a strange curse. Through which supernatural effects does it
manifest? How did you become cursed? Did you bother a magical creature or explore
a forbidden place? Who might tell you how to break it?
When you acquire this Quirk, describe the nature of your curse and tie it to one of
the threats present in your world. Once this threat is resolved, you will finally have a
chance to break free from the curse - describe how you expect this to happen.
Examples: nearby animals become aggressive; waters become treacherous when you
swim or sail; invisible sprites misplace your belongings.
When you are about to perform a Check, you may instead describe how your curse
gets in the way and automatically roll a fumble (both dice are treated as if you had
rolled a 1 on them). If you do, you receive 2 Fabula Points instead of 1, and generate
an opportunity as normal.
If you ever manage to break the curse, immediately gain a Heroic Skill of your choice
(you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless
they include a Skill you don’t have). This includes choosing a Heroic Skill for a Class
you do not have.

9 ELEMENTAL SOUL
You are deeply infused with the power of a natural element. Who among your
forebears first received this magical spark? What troubles has it caused you?
Choose your elemental damage type: air, bolt, earth, fire, or ice. You gain Resistance
to the chosen damage type; additionally, whenever you deal damage, you may change
its type so that it matches your elemental damage type. However, you also become
Vulnerable to a different damage type chosen among those five.
You also gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Elementalism discipline, but only if
those Rituals manipulate your chosen element (respectively air, electricity, earth/rock,
fire, and ice/water).
9 FLIGHT
You belong to a unique heritage of humanoids who have the ability to fly or levitate.
How does this work? Is it magical, or do you have wings? How did this particular
advantage shape the history and society of your people? How do people usually react
when they see you?
You are able to fly. In addition to the obvious advantage in mobility,
your melee attacks can target flying creatures and you cannot
be targeted by melee attacks unless the attacker is flying
or is somehow able to reach flying targets.
While in Crisis or unable to fly freely (such
as when you’re inside a vehicle designed
for human-sized creatures or in a narrow
corridor), you lose all benefits granted by
this Quirk. Additionally, when you suffer
air, bolt or ice damage during a conflict
scene, you lose the benefits of this
Quirk until the start of your next turn.
“No blame in being

9 MYSTERIOUS GRIMOIRE
You came into possession of an old and hefty magical tome; sometimes, scribbles and
advice appear on its pages, helping you in your adventures. Where did you find it?
What kind of personality emerges from the text’s style and tone?
As long as you have this Quirk, your grimoire is an indestructible artifact that cannot be
lost or stolen unless as a consequence of Surrender.
When your group stumbles upon a danger or discovery after a travel roll, you may
ask the Game Master a single question concerning that danger or discovery (you
may ask it immediately or save it for later); the Game Master answers truthfully and
describes how the answer appears on your grimoire.
Once your grimoire has answered 10 questions, it almost shared all of its knowledge
with you: choose one of the following options.
 Awakened Consciousness: you lose this Quirk and the grimoire turns into a Non-
Player Character; create this NPC together with the rest of your group, giving them a
name and describing their appearance. They do not have an NPC profile and do not
take part in Checks or conflicts, but they learn two spells of your choice among those
found in the Elementalist, Entropist, and Spiritist lists (see Core Rulebook, pages
188, 192 and 208 respectively). Once per conflict, if requested, the NPC will cast
one of these spells. Spells cast this way will be cast at the end of the current round,
require no Mind Points, and use 2d10 for the Magic Check (if needed).
 Hidden Magic: you lose this Quirk, but your grimoire will still share a final and most
powerful secret. You acquire a Heroic Skill of your choice among Comet, Extra Spells,
Hope, and Volcano (see Core Rulebook from page 232 onwards; you may choose a
Skill whose requirements you do not fulfill).
You could also use this Quirk to introduce a new Player Character (and Player) in your
group; if you do, the character who had taken this Quirk should receive the benefits
listed by Hidden Magic instead of those in Awakened Conscience. Suggested Quirks
for a Player Character brought into a campaign this way are Arboreal, Robot, The
Beast Who Spoke, and The Long Dream.
Whatever your choice, the grimoire goes back to being a completely normal book
and the Game Master chooses one option: the grimoire provides a key clue regarding
a threat that is present in your world; or the grimoire reveals the existence of a new
threat and provides a key clue about it.

9 OUTCAST FAIRY
Once upon a time, you lived with your kin in the Realm of Fairies, in close contact with
the stream of souls... but it has been long since you last visited. What went wrong?
What is the state of the Realm at the moment? Who governs it?
You may verbally communicate with any creature belonging to the beast, elemental,
and plant Species.
You learn one spell of your choice among those found in the Elementalist, Entropist,
and Spiritist lists (see Core Rulebook, pages 188, 192 and 208 respectively);
additionally, you gain the ability to perform Rituals whose effects fall within the
Ritualism discipline, and you may use these Rituals to transport creatures in and out
of the Realm of Fairies.
However, you also possess a unique weakness typical of fairies: decide it together with
your group. Once per session (approximately four hours of play), the Game Master
may give you 1 Fabula Point in order to have sudden complications arise due to this
weakness or have you automatically fail a Check (they must do so before the Check is
performed; the Check’s Result and High Roll are both treated as being 0).
Examples: you are allergic to iron; you must count all poured grains of sand or salt; if
you see someone perform a specific gesture, you must do the same.
9 ROBOT
You are an artificial body in which a mysterious life shines, lone descendant of an age
lost to time. Do you look organic or mechanical? What prevents you from perceiving or
communicating like a normal human would? What fragmented memories do you still
hold from the time you were created?
You are not considered a living creature and gain Immunity to poison damage and
Resistance to earth damage. You are also immune to the poisoned status effect.
You do not need to breathe, eat or drink, but you still follow the normal rules for
resting; you also recover Hit Points and recover from status effects as normal.
You gain a +2 bonus to all Checks you perform to examine or interact with machines,
technology and constructs (except for Accuracy Checks and Magic Checks).

9 STUBBORN SCION
You hail from the wealthiest, most influential family in this region. On what do they

you really can’t stand, and why did it lead you to join the other characters?
If you choose this Quirk during character creation, increase your initial savings (see
Core Rulebook, page 165) by 1000 zenit.
Additionally, you are accompanied by two fiercely loyal bodyguards: give them a name
and describe their appearance. They do not have an NPC profile and never take part in
Checks or conflicts, but you are inseparable and they somehow appear whenever you
need their help. They offer the following benefits:
 Be careful! When you suffer damage, you may halve it.
 Here is the information you previously requested. During a Rest, you may ask the
Game Master one question; they will answer truthfully.
 Stay down, I’ll take care of this! When you create an elemental shard, you may have
it deal extra damage equal to【 5 + half your level】.
Whenever you make use of one of these benefits, your bodyguards suffer 1d6 Fatigue
Points; as long as they have 10 or more Fatigue Points, you cannot rely on them.
Fatigue is shared between bodyguards; it is not tracked individually.
At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), your bodyguards recover
from 1d6 Fatigue Points (to a minimum of zero).

Many Quirks bring complex themes to your table: for instance, The Long Dream
presents a dynamic that can be dangerously close to that of a terminal illness;
Robot, Outcast Fairy, The Beast Who Spoke and Underchild will likely lead to
the character being seen as an anomaly or even as a threat; Stubborn Scion can
involve generational conflict and toxic family pressure; Cursed or Survivor imply
seriously traumatic experiences. When you choose and customize your Quirks,
commit to respecting the personal boundaries of those who play with you. Use
lines and veils (see Core Rulebook, page 140) and be ready to pause the game
if a scene is making someone uncomfortable. Be kind to each other, and be kind
to yourselves.

CHAPTER
9 SURVIVOR
You are among the few who survived a natural catastrophe or the attack of a dreadful
creature. Do you believe someone is responsible for this? Were you able to keep in
contact with any other survivors? Do you think reconstruction is possible?
Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points and maximum Mind Points by 5.
Choose one option: gain the ability to equip martial melee and ranged weapons,
martial armor, and martial shields; or learn any one spell from the Elementalist or
Spiritist lists; or permanently increase your maximum Inventory Points by 2.
9 THE BEAST WHO SPOKE
You belong to a long line of magical beasts who protected human villages over the
centuries; nowadays, however, humanity has forgotten your role. Where do you make
your nest? Do you know of any of your kind who are still alive? Who, among the other
Player Characters, has shown interest or respect towards your nature?
You may not equip any items, with the exception of accessories and weapon and
armor modules (see Pilot Class, page 158 of the Techno Fantasy Atlas). However, as
long as your armor slot is empty, you gain a +2 bonus to Defense and a +2 bonus to
Magic Defense.
You also gain two benefits of your choice among the following:
 You may also equip custom weapons (see page 112 for more).
 You learn one NPC spell (pages 310-311 of the Core Rulebook; you cannot choose
the spell Devastation; if a Magic Check is required, use【 MIG + WLP】): customize the
spell as needed (name, damage type, status effects etc.).
 Your attacks with unarmed strikes deal 6 extra damage. This amount increases to 10
extra damage if you are level 30 or higher.

W
9 THE LONG DREAM
Long ago, your spirit dwelled in nature; then, something brought you to take on a
human form, but it won’t be forever. Was it a prayer or some kind of magic? What part
of your appearance betrays your origin? Do you fear that last farewell?
At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), before assigning XP, roll
2d20. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your current character level, the
last farewell approaches.
When a rule or ability requires you to spend Hit Points, Mind Points, or Fabula Points,
you may instead ignore that cost. If you do, the last farewell approaches.
At the end of a scene where you ignored a cost as described above, if the last farewell
has approached at least 10 times already, the moment has come for you to leave
the world of humans. You shall forever return to your original form as a natural
and inanimate object: together with your group, take your time to roleplay one last
bittersweet moment before you go. The same happens if you Sacrifice yourself.
Examples: you might turn into a great guardian tree, into a visage on the side of a cliff,
into a uniquely shaped rock, or into the brightest star in the sky.
A character whose last farewell has come is considered dead in game terms, and
cannot be brought back. However, from now on all Player Characters in the campaign
(including your new character) will receive 1 additional Fabula Point at the start of
each session (approximately four hours of play).
9 TRAVELING WORKSHOP
You own a transport that also acts as your shop and laboratory. How did you obtain it?
How does it move, and what energy fuels it? What makes it extremely recognizable?
Normally, how do people react to its passage?
You may only choose this Quirk if your character has acquired one or more Classes
among Gourmet (see page 148) and Tinkerer (see Core Rulebook, page 210).
You obtain a land vehicle (see Core Rulebook, page 125). This vehicle is big enough
to accommodate you and the rest of your group, plus two or three guests, but unfit
for combat.
If a Project requires a special ingredient or material, you may spend 1 Fabula Point to
suddenly stumble upon something similar in your workshop; if you do, the invention
must have a terrible flaw (see Core Rulebook, page 134).

CHAPTER
9 UNDERCHILD
There isn’t much you remember about your past, but upon awakening you found
yourself in the depths. Once you reached the surface, you realized you weren’t exactly
like everyone else... you are spontaneously attuned to ancient technology, and boast a
strange power reserve you can draw from. Who was the first person you encountered?
What items did you have with you? Are you afraid of regaining your memories?
When a rule or ability requires you to spend 100 or fewer Hit Points, Mind Points,
or Inventory Points during a conflict, you may instead ignore that cost. If you do, you
cannot ignore a cost this way again until the end of your next Rest. Describe where
this intense but ephemeral energy stems from!
Examples: a magic gem hidden in your left eye; a power generator grafted to your
arm; an arcane circuit that resembles an intricate tattoo.
Additionally, when you encounter a contraption or creature connected to ancient
technology or to a ruins’ past, you may choose one option: ask the Game Master
its purpose; or ask the Game Master what can activate it; or ask the Game Master
what can deactivate it. The Game Master answers truthfully and you describe a brief
flashback that reveals the answer.
After you receive an answer this way for the sixth time, you remember the real reason
why you had been left dormant underground, and the Game Master chooses one
option: you remember a key clue regarding a threat that is present in your world; or
you remember the existence of a new threat and receive a key clue about it.
Note that you will keep all benefits from this Quirk after this revelation (both the
ability to ignore costs and to ask questions).

Camp Activities are an optional rule designed to give greater spotlight to resting scenes
(see Core Rulebook, page 91) and provide more options in addition to just increasing or
modifying Bonds. While they have been created with a natural fantasy tone in mind, they
can be used in any campaign.
Using this rule will not make Player Characters especially more powerful than normal,
but surely offers an improvement in flexibility.
CHOOSING CAMP ACTIVITIES
If you use this optional rule, each Player Character gains access to two different Camp
Activities, chosen during character creation from the list in the following pages.
Make sure to avoid redundant Camp Activities within the same group, and to choose
Activities that fit your Player Character’s concept and Identity.
USING CAMP ACTIVITIES
When Player Characters play a resting scene (be while inside a settlement or in the
wilderness), each Player Character who takes part in it may perform one among the
Camp Activities they have access to, describing it and applying its benefits to the
chosen target.
It should be noted that each character may choose how to employ the resting scene,
independently from everyone else.
Example: Brandon, Martha, and Ylua pause to rest in the city, spending 20 zenit each.
They decide to play a resting scene inside the tavern; Brandon Sleeps Soundly to gain
an additional action in the future, while Martha prepares a Double Portion for Ylua,
who is often the target of the party’s healing spells. Seeing Martha’s kindness, Ylua
decides to use this scene to Gather a few useful ingredients for the cook... hoping not
to get into any trouble!
Whether they perform a Camp Activity or not, characters may still use the resting scene
to adjust their Bonds (see Core Rulebook, page 91).

CHAPTER
KEEPING TRACK OF THE BENEFITS
Many Camp Activities provide a benefit
that can be used only once before
the next rest; to make sure you easily
remember which characters have access to
each specific benefits, you could use tokens,
counters, or other small objects that express the
personality of whatever Player Character performed
the corresponding Camp Activity.
Example: Brandon’s player keeps track of Sleep Soundly
using a pink plastic button; on the other hand, Martha’s player
gives a little badge portraying a slice of cake to anyone who
benefits from her Double Portion.
If the benefit carries over from one session to another, instead,
you can simply take note of it in a clearly visibile area on your
character sheet!
CAMP ACTIVITY TARGET
Camp Forge Yourself
Choose one option: you repair a damaged item owned by the group; or you create
a single basic weapon, armor, or shield of your choice (see pages 130-133 of the
Core Rulebook) without paying its cost in zenit; or you destroy a single piece of
equipment owned by the group and obtain a material whose value is equal to the
cost of the destroyed item (see page 74 for more information on materials).
Cartography Yourself
Once before the next rest, after your group makes a travel roll, you may reroll the die
and keep the new result.
Combat Lesson One ally
Once before the next rest, after making an Accuracy Check or a Magic Check for an
offensive spell (r), the target may add a bonus of +4 to the Result of the Check.

You spend your time looking for useful items; describe how, then roll 1d6.
w 1. Ouch! You recover half the normal amount of HP and MP during this rest.
w 2. Not what I was looking for... The target regains 2 Inventory Points.
w 3-5. Hoho, this can be useful! The target regains 3 Inventory Points.
w 6. Jackpot! The target regains 3 Inventory Points, and you also find an amount of
zenit equal to【 your character’s level × 50】.
Gathering A character with the Gourmet Class
You look for ingredients in the area; describe how, then roll 1d6.
w 1. H-help! At the end of this rest, the entire group will be caught in an easy conflict
against a threat whose level is equal to the group level.
w 2. Will these be okay... The target receives 2 ingredients with random tastes.
w 3-5. Looks tasty! The target receives 3 ingredients with random tastes.
w 6. Ah, these! The target receives 3 ingredients, each with a taste of their choice.
Magic Lesson One ally
Choose a single spell among those you know. Once before the next rest, the target may
perform the Spell action to cast the spell you chose (they must still pay its MP cost and
perform any Magic Checks as needed).
Martial Practice Yourself
Once before the next rest, when you perform an attack, you may grant that attack
multi (2) or increase its multi property by one point.

CAMP ACTIVITY TARGET
Massage One ally
Once before the next rest, if the target is about to pay a Mind Point cost, they may
halve that MP cost. This benefit cannot be applied to a Ritual’s MP cost.
Midnight Oil Yourself
You generate 3 points of progress for a single Project of your choice.
Pep Talk One ally
Once before the next rest, if the target is about to recover Mind Points, they may
double the amount of Mind Points recovered.
Planning One ally
Once before the next rest, after the target performs a Group Check as leader or
performs a Check to examine someone or something, they may add a bonus of +4 to
the Result of that Check.
Sleep Soundly Yourself
Once before the next rest, you may perform an additional action on your turn during
a conflict scene. This action must be used to perform the Equipment, Hinder, or
Inventory action.
Training Yourself
Once before the next rest, if you are about to suffer one or more status effects from
the same source, you may instead choose not to suffer any of those status effects.
You might create new Camp Activities for your characters; if you do so, try to
keep them on the same power level as these. Then again, if your group has a
passion for fantasy cooking, you might change this rule so that each Activity is
instead a special dish created by your character, and always has one ally as the
target - sharing is caring, after all!

FLORALIST FREE BENEFITS
 Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points or Mind Points by 5 (your choice).
FLORALIST SKILLS
BATTLE GARDENING (ç3)
After you plant a magiseed through the Chloromancy Skill (not when using Graft), you
may choose one option: perform a free attack with an equipped weapon; or perform
the Spell action for free, casting a spell with a total Mind Point cost equal to or lower
than【 5 + (SL × 5)】 (you must still pay its MP cost). Treat the High Roll (HR) of your
Accuracy Check or Magic Check as being equal to 0 when determining damage dealt
by this attack or spell.
CHLOROMANCY (ç10)
Each time you acquire this Skill, you discover a new type of magiseed from the list
found in the next pages.
During a conflict, if there are no magiseeds in your garden, you may use an action and
spend 20 Mind Points to plant a magiseed of a type you have discovered. The rules for
the garden and for magiseed growth can be found in the next pages.
GRAFT
As long as there is a magiseed in your garden and 1 or more sections of your Growth
Clock are filled, you may use an action to remove that magiseed from your garden:
if you do, plant a different magiseed among those you have discovered (keep the
current filled sections of your Growth Clock unchanged).
TREE OF LIFE (ç5)
When you remove a magiseed from your garden, you may choose one creature you can
see: if that creature is in Crisis, they recove【r 5 + (SL × 5)】 Hit Points.
VERDANT SWAY
You gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Ritualism discipline; additionally, you
may use Ritualism to create, animate, and/or control vegetation, pollen, spores, and
toxins (but you cannot create nor control plant-Species NPCs this way).
 When did you first discover a magiseed, and where?
 Who taught you how to tend to plants and flowers?
 How did you implement magiseeds in your combat style?
 Are there many practicing your art, or are you the exception?
140
W
THE GARDEN
When you plant a magiseed, it takes root in your garden until removed. Your garden
is an abstract space whose appearance varies depending on your character’s look: it
might be a pot on their back, a gap along their blade, or even the ground under their
feet. Your garden can only contain one magiseed at a time, and any magiseeds in your
garden are automatically removed at the end of each scene.
THE GROWTH CLOCK
When you acquire the Chloromancy Skill, you also receive a Growth Clock which is
present only during conflict scenes and represents the cycle of life in your garden.
 Your Growth Clock has 4 sections, and it begins each scene empty.
 At the end of your turn, if a magiseed is present in your garden, fill 1 section of your
Growth Clock; then, if there is still a magiseed in your garden and that magiseed has
an “at the end of your turn” effect (see below), apply that effect.
 When you fill the fourth section of your Growth Clock, remove the magiseed in your
garden, then erase all sections of your Growth Clock.
 Sections of your Growth Clock may not be filled nor erased in any way other than
described above, through Brambleheart and Green Thumb (pages 162 and 166), or
through effects that explicitly affect Growth Clocks.
MAGISEED EFFECTS
Magiseeds can have passive effects, or have effects that trigger at the end of your
turn, after your Growth Clock has increased.
 The effects of a magiseed apply only while it is present in your garden, and they vary
depending on the current number of filled sections in your Growth Clock (T).
 You only apply the effect corresponding to the exact number of currently filled
sections in your Growth Clock, not any effect above or below it.
 If a magiseed’s effect deals damage, it deals 5 extra damage if you are level 30 or
higher. If a magiseed’s effect causes Hit Point and/or Mind Point loss and/or recovery,
the amount increases by 10 if you are level 30 or higher.

Cooking may be considered a
common skill, but Gourmets
refine their knowledge of
foodstuffs to a level that is
nothing short of supernatural:
they refine the art of extracting
spiritual energies from every
ingredient, infusing meals
with powerful magical effects!
While most Gourmets are
content with simply settling
down in a town or village
and making a living off their
skills, some wander the world
in a lifelong search for new
ingredients. n

COOKING (ç5)
When you rest inside a settlement, you gain【 SL】 ingredients (see next page).
You may use an action and combine 2 or 3 ingredients to prepare a delicacy (see next
page) and choose one option: you apply its effects to yourself or an ally you can see;
or you perform a free attack with a weapon you have equipped. This attack deals no
damage, but you apply the delicacy’s effects to each enemy hit by the attack.
You may carry up to 10 +【 SL × 5】 ingredients, and they will never spoil until you
use them; if you take this Skill during character creation, you begin play with ten
ingredients with random tastes.
KNIFE AND FORK
When you perform the free attack granted by the Cooking Skill, if you combined no
more than 2 ingredients, you may have the attack deal damage as normal. If you do,
you treat your High Roll (HR) as 0 when calculating damage dealt by this attack.
MADE WITH LOVE (ç3)
When you use the Cooking Skill and choose to apply the effects of the delicacy to
yourself or an ally you can see, you may spend up to【 SL × 10】 MP. For every 10 MP
you spend this way, apply the delicacy’s effects to an additional ally you can see.
SALT AND PEPPER
When you prepare a delicacy, you may spend 2 Inventory Points: if you do, change the
taste of one ingredient to a different taste of your choice.

INGREDIENTS & DELICACIES
W
The Gourmet Class is designed around experimenting new taste combinations, as well
as using these combinations to come up with a variety of strategies. To help you keep
track of all this information you can use a cookbook sheet, which can be downloaded
from fabulaultima.com.
GAINING INGREDIENTS
You will normally receive ingredients through the Cooking and Traveling Cook Skills;
you might also receive them as rewards during play. When you obtain an ingredient,
you’re never too sure what it will taste like — roll a d6 to determine the ingredient’s
taste using the table below, then describe its appearance and give it a name.
You may also purchase ingredients from stall, shops or merchants: the price is 10
zenit for an ingredient with a random taste, or 20 zenit for an ingredient with a taste
of your choice.
INGREDIENT TASTE
1. Bitter 2. Salty 3. Sour 4. Sweet 5. Umami 6. Your choice
Example: after traversing the Petrified Forest, you gain two ingredients thanks to the
Traveling Cook Skill. You roll a 1 and 5 for their tastes, which means one tastes bitter
and the other tastes umami.
You decide to call the first ingredient “Fossil Honey” and the second ingredient
“Stonebark Shroom”. You record both of them on your cookbook sheet, placing them
in the matching taste columns.

CHAPTER
TASTES AND DELICACIES
When you use the Cooking Skill, you combine two or three ingredients to generate a
special delicacy with powerful effects that will be applied to its targets.
 Every different combination of two tastes (even if it’s the same taste used twice!) will
add an effect to the delicacy.
 When you combine two tastes you never combined before, determine the effect of that
combination by rolling a d12 and consulting the chart on the next page; most entries
also require you to make a choice (such as a specific damage type or status effect). Once
you’re done, record the resulting effect on your cookbook sheet: from this moment on,
that taste combination will always produce that exact effect when you use it.
 No two combinations of tastes in your cookbook sheet can have identical effects.
When you determine the effect of a new combination, you must make your choices
in such a way that the resulting effect has no precedents (for instance, by selecting a
different damage type or status effect); if you can’t, reroll the d12.
 When completed, your cookbook sheet will feature a total of 15 effects, one for each
possible pair of tastes.
Example: you combine three ingredients, one of them salty and two of them bitter.
The resulting delicacy features two combinations (bitter + bitter and bitter + salty),
which means it will have two different effects.
In the past, you combined bitter + bitter and rolled a 4, which means the effect allows
for MP recovery; on the other hand, you never combined bitter + salty before, so you
need to determine this combination’s effect by rolling dice.
You roll a 1, and must choose a status effect for this effect; since you already chose
recovery from weak for the sour + sweet combination in the past, you decide to opt
for dazed. From now on, the bitter + salty combination will always allow you to heal
the target from dazed.
Now that you’ve done this, you know that your delicacy allows every target to heal
from the dazed status effect and also recover 40 Mind Points.
Delicacies created through the Cooking Skill have an immediate effect and are then
destroyed; if you want to prepare foods with unique effects and use them later, you
must instead use the rules for Projects (see Core Rulebook, page 134).

CHAPTER
SPECIAL RULES OF EFFECTS
Delicacies and their effects follow a few unique rules.
 Each delicacy always features one, two, or three effects, depending on which taste
combinations you used (the effects may also be four or six if you use the All You Can
Eat Heroic Skill, on page 161); you decide in which order to apply these effects, and
may choose to forgo any number of them (this choice must be exactly the same for
all targets of the delicacy).
 Effects 5 to 12 can only be applied during conflict scenes.
 A delicacy can only have one type 5 effect (which is to say, a damage-dealing effect);
if a delicacy has two or more type 5 effects due to the taste combinations you used,
you must choose one of them and forgo the others.
 A delicacy can only have one type 12 effect (which is to say, a damage type-changing
effect); if a delicacy has two or more type 12 effects due to the taste combinations
you used, you must choose one of them and forgo the others.
Other than that, all of a delicacy’s effects are cumulative, and will be fully applied to
each of its target.
Example: if you obtain a type 2 effect on sweet + umami, a type 5 effect on bitter +
umami, and a type 9 effect on bitter + sweet, the delicacy created combining these
tastes will be able to deal damage, inflict a status effect, and also prevent the use of
spells for a brief period!
AND FINALLY, A BIT OF ADVICE!
This Class is quite atypical: there is no real way to perfectly control the role your
character will cover, because your abilities are procedurally generated over the course
of the campaign. However, remember that you may prepare delicacies outside of
conflict scenes: it will cost you some ingredients, true, but you will be able to “scout”
the effects ahead of time and avoid trial and error during a critical situation. Other
than that, pay attention to which effects best synergize with each other and with
the rest of your group, and take advantage of the multi property to apply the same
delicacy to two or more enemies!

for a dish that can summon the soul of the deceased.”

INVOKER SKILLS
ELEMENTAL HARMONY (ç2)
You may verbally communicate with creatures of the elemental Species.
When you restore a creature’s Hit Points with an invocation or spell, if an elemental is
present on the scene, the restored amount is increased by【 SL × 5】.
INVOCATION (ç3)
You may use an action and spend 5 Mind Points to perform an invocation, drawing
energy from one of the wellsprings present on the scene (see next page). You【r SL】 in
this Skill determines which invocations you have access to.
LINKED INVOCATION (ç3)
When you perform an invocation, you may spend up to【 SL × 10】 additional Mind
Points. For every 10 Mind Points you spend this way, the invocation may target an
additional creature you can see.
RIPPLES (ç5)
After an enemy you can see loses Hit Points due to damage dealt by one of your
allies, if that damage was increased by one or more of your “hex” invocations, you
may perform a free attack with a weapon you have equipped. This attack may only
target that enemy, and receives a bonus equal to【 SL】 to its Accuracy Check; if it is
successful, all its damage becomes of the same type dealt by your ally, and all “hex”
invocations present on its target end immediately after the attack has been resolved.
If two or more enemies trigger this Skill at the same time, you can perform a free
attack against each of them, in whatever order you prefer.
WELLSPRING EXPANSION (ç5)
As long as you have a weapon belonging to the arcane, bow, brawling, flail, sword, or

DETERMINING AVAILABLE WELLSPRINGS
During each scene, your surroundings grant you two different wellsprings: the Game
Master tells you what they are. Remember to describe how wellsprings manifest in the
scene; they may be natural features, objects, or even creatures.
Example: during a battle taking place on a steam-powered airship amidst stormy
clouds, any two of air, fire, lightning and water would make sense.
PERFORMING AN INVOCATION
When you perform an invocation, choose one option you have access to among those
in the table below (provided the corresponding wellspring is available in the scene);
then, apply its effects to one creature you can see.
Your Skill Level in the Invocation Skill determines which invocations you have access
to【: SL 1】 enables “blast” invocations【, SL 2】 enables “blast” and “hex” invocations,
and【 SL 3】 gives you access to all invocations.
Example: if air and earth wellsprings are available and your Skill Level is 2, you have
access to Aero Blast, Aero Hex, Geo Blast, and Geo Hex.
If an invocation deals damage, it will deal 5 extra damage if you are level 20 or
higher, or 10 extra damage if you are level 40 or higher.
Similarly, if an invocation causes the target to recover Hit Points or lose Mind Points,
the amount will increase by 10 if you are level 20 or higher, or by 20 if you are level
40 or higher.

again until after your Growth Clock has become completely empty.
Additionally, damage dealt by your magiseeds ignores Resistances.
INNER WELLSPRING
Requirements: you must have mastered the Invoker Class.
When you acquire this Heroic Skill and whenever you rest, you may choose one
wellspring: air, earth, fire, lightning, or water. If you do, you gain the following benefits
until your next rest:
 You always treat the chosen wellspring as being available during each scene, in
addition to whatever wellsprings are already available.
 You may perform Rituals of the Elementalism discipline, but only if those Rituals
manipulate the element of the chosen wellspring.
 You gain Resistance to the damage type corresponding to the chosen wellspring.
 When you deal damage, you may change its type to the one corresponding to the
chosen wellspring. If you do, that damage ignores Resistances.
POWER NAP
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Guardian,
Merchant, and Wayfarer.
On your turn during a conflict, you may use an action to recover an amount of Hit Points
and Mind Points equal to 【20 + half your level】 and also recover from all status
effects. If you do, your turn ends immediately, you lose the ability to hear and see, and
your Defense and Magic Defense scores become equal to 5 and cannot be modified
in any way (but you may still use the Protect Skill from the Guardian Class, if you have
acquired it!). These penalties last until the start of your next turn, until after you lose
Hit Points, or until after you are hit by an attack or offensive spell (r).

ANTAGONISTS
This book’s fourth and final chapter delves into the creation of natural fantasy enemy
NPCs – especially Villains. Game Masters can combine it with similar advice from the
Core Rulebook (mostly from page 292 onwards) to plan riveting conflict scenes for
all game levels. As usual, you can use the material as is or adapt it to your liking by
following the advice below.
NATURAL FANTASY VILLAINS
An introductory section containing tips and advice for creating and playing pivotal
antagonists in the natural fantasy style.
VILLAIN EXAMPLES
Five different enemy NPCs – one each for levels 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 – that make ideal
natural fantasy Villains. For each, you’ll find this information:
 History. The Villain’s base concept and possible backstory.
 Profile. The Villain’s statistics, as described on page 320 of the Core Rulebook.
 Tactics. The Villain’s preferred combat tactics.
 Extra content. One or more additional ideas, including tips for modifying the Villain’s
profile, possible supporting enemies, and even additional phases (see Core Rulebook,
page 301) that you can use during conflicts.
These Villains were designed to spark the Game Master’s imagination and assume
a group of 4 well-rounded PCs. Remember that some of their abilities might not
conform to the standard cost for NPC Skills (see Core Rulebook, page 303) and that
you’ll likely need to tweak these Villains before adding them to your campaign. To
balance things out, consider your Player Characters’ capacities and then modify any
opposing Affinities, immunities to status effects, damage types, or other parameters
that could be frustrating to deal with or unsuitable for your group’s campaign.

W
NATURAL FANTASY VILLAINS
When you create a natural fantasy antagonist, the information on page 254 of the
Core Rulebook is an excellent starting point, but there are a few extra things to
remember, just as there are for Player Characters.
BASIC PRINCIPLES
The natural fantasy genre presents a significant variety of archetypal Villains, but we
can still infer some common key traits:
 A link to the past. These antagonists have one or more elements that link them to
the past of the setting: some are obsessed by ancient legends; other crave power and
authority lent by millennia-old magics and technologies, or want to wipe out every
last trace of them; finally, some are entities who survived an ancient calamity or were
created in the distant past.
 Familiar concepts. A natural fantasy antagonist’s motivations and origin are often
linked to needs, feelings, doubts, or emergencies that you might have had a brush
with at least once in your personal life. As much as this might unsettle you, a part
of you should be able to understand, perhaps at an instinctual level, what these
Villains represent.
 Catastrophic results. When a natural fantasy Villain reaches their goals, the
consequences are devastating: be it the awakening of a truly ancient danger, a
permanent alteration to the ecosystem, or the extermination of entire communities,
the Villain’s victory will tear open a wound in this world.
The Game Master is given three main tools for introducing these Villains into the
narrative and diving deep into their origins and objectives:
 Stories, relics and traditions. If a Villain is the incarnation of an ancient danger,
references to their existence should gradually appear during the campaign: these
sources are often vague or partly contradictory – fertile ground for studies and
speculations.
 Game Master scenes. Above all else, these scenes are useful to add depth to the
antagonists, revealing their doubts and hesitations. When dealing with Villains that
are closer in nature to a cataclysm or a supernatural presence, these scenes can show
omens of their arrival and a growing sense of foreboding.
 Conflicts. During conflicts, natural fantasy Villains tend to fully embrace one of two
extremes: some speak openly with the protagonists, explaining their reasons, while
others march forward, undeterred and silent, toward their objective.

CHAPTER
THE FOUR ARCHETYPES
In natural fantasy, Villains often fit into one of four recurring types, with some very
distinctive characteristics.
9 THE ARROGANT
This Villain is driven by ego: craving power, money and/or knowledge, they never
stop to consider the destructive consequences of their actions and see the world as
something to examine, dissect, exploit, and optimize.
Examples: an adventurer willing to commit any kind of atrocity to collect valuable
trophies; a pioneer ready to destroy the ecosystem to build roads and railways.
9 THE PROTECTOR
This Villain wants to protect one community at the detriment of another. They believe
they are doing what is necessary and, if defeated, might even become an ally.
Examples: a warrior looking for an ancient weapon that will let him impose a truce
between clans; a huntress who wants to exterminate every predator in the continent.
9 THE OUTSIDER
Either supernatural or artificial, this antagonist follows a personal and unfathomable
logic. They rarely speak, and when they do it muddies the waters even more, or they
quote events, rules or information completely unknown to the characters.
Examples: a demon or ghost coming to reclaim a tribute in accordance with a
forgotten tradition; an artificial intelligence reawakened in the wrong age.
9 THE CATASTROPHE
This Villain could be a monster, a beast, an elemental phenomenon, a disease, or
even an expanding ecosystem (see next page). They are the incarnation of a looming
disaster and there is no chance for parlay.
Examples: a scourge created by a cyclical curse; an infection that corrupts animals
and plants, turning them into abominations; a wandering volcano close to erupting.
174
W
ENVIRONMENTAL ANTAGONISTS
Sometimes, natural fantasy Villains manifest in the form of miasmas, curses and
afflictions that change any ecosystem their influence spreads to.
It should be noted that the antagonist is not the environment itself, but rather
whatever force is corrupting it – this is often the result of actions by the world’s
ancient’s inhabitants. This isn’t a struggle between people and nature, but a war where
both, side by side, face the consequences of a tragic, faded past, in an attempt to
understand it so that it doesn’t repeat itself.
Among the most common environmental antagonists are magical phenomena, curses,
elemental imbalances, and diseases born of ancient experiments.
When it comes to game rules, these Villains offer some interesting possibilities:
 Environmental effects. The environment itself might add special effects during
conflicts: a corrupting miasma that damages any creature suffering from a specific
status effect at the end of each round, a magical desertification that halves any
healing received by living creatures, or an elemental aura that empowers or weakens a
specific type of damage. These effects can be very powerful and should be considered
an additional opponent for the sake of conflict building.
 Shared Ultima Points. The most dangerous creatures among those affected by the
corruption might be able to spend Ultima Points from the Villain’s pool to invoke
Traits and Recover (see Core Rulebook, page 101). They shouldn’t be able to Escape,
but they are considered Villains for the purpose of Skills and game effects.
 Fabula Points and atmosphere. If a Villain manifests through environmental
corruption, the Player Characters should receive a Fabula Point every time their
influence become especially noticeable, for example in the guise of a terrible omen
or when a creature is shown to be a thrall to the Villain’s will (see Shared Ultima
Points above). Game Master scenes are particularly useful for this purpose.
 Final battle. Usually, an environmental antagonist cannot be confronted directly
until the protagonists reach their core or incarnation and free the region from their
influence – a liberation that is sometimes only temporary…
 Altered wellsprings. This is a very specific option, but if your group includes a
character that can use invocations (see page 156), the Villain’s influence might
create new wellsprings outside of the standard list or, perhaps, alter the existing
wellsprings over the course of a conflict.

CHAPTER
ON A SMALLER SCALE
One recurring element of natural fantasy campaigns is that they limit themselves
to a rather small space and time frame: pretty often, a natural fantasy Villain might
renounce their goal or be permanently defeated after just one or two confrontations.
From this point of view, the number of Ultima Points available to these Villains
might become a problem: a Villain might have 5 or 6 Ultima Points left when their
story has reached a satisfying conclusion in terms of narrative.
This problem might present itself in any short campaign, but the usual pace of natural
fantasy games makes it more noticeable. Here is some advice to offset it:
 Avoid supreme Villains. If you foresee a short and focused campaign set in a small
region, you can easily limit yourself to a few minor Villains and a single major Villain,
without resorting to supreme Villains. If you change your mind, you can always call
for an escalation (see Core Rulebook, page 102).
 Make Villains fearsome. Spend Ultima Points every time a Villain fails a Check,
misses a target, or is afflicted by two or more status effects; every now and then, do it
even when they succeed, just to improve the Result or the High Roll!
 Fiction first. If the Player Characters’ actions create a situation where the Villain no
longer has a reason to act (a rather common occurrence in natural fantasy, where
many antagonists are driven by very simple needs), it’s not wrong to discard all the
remaining Ultima Points and stop considering this character a Villain.
SUBVERTING THE PREMISES
Natural fantasy campaigns offer excellent chances to subvert many conventions of the
JRPG genre and design Villains who are essentially invincible if battle against them is
approached as usual (for example, the Heart of Eldgren on page 205).
Examples: a ghost that, if defeated, comes back to haunt the village at night, unless
someone returns a specific item to them; a monster under a curse who, if brought to
0 Hit Points without purifying them first via a Ritual or Project, completely loses their
conscience and becomes an abomination; a truly ancient android who, when in Crisis,
automatically Surrenders if convinced to trust humanity via a Clock.
“You humans have a habit of considering cruel
what is merely equitable. For years you stole
my children, and now I shall steal yours.”

TONITRANEA REX
W
The Mountains of Edessa are famous for their electrore formations, which create
a rather unique biome. However, the recent lowering of temperatures across the
region, caused by a mysterious turbulence from the west, significantly reduced the
charge stored within said mineral, causing the deterioration of the flora native to
the region and forcing many local species to migrate. Among these species are
the exceedingly rare Thunder Spiders. Usually peaceful, once outside their natural
habitat these huge arthropods become extremely ravenous – they eat constantly
and grow beyond measure. This accelerated growth is very painful, and makes them
even more aggressive.
A truly gigantic specimen was recently spotted in the valley, so ferocious that the
population of nearby villages was forced to flee their homes. They talk with fear and
respect about the Tonitranea Rex, the Lord of Thunder. Its hunting ground grows by
the day, threatening not just the people of the valley but the balance of the region’s
entire ecosystem.

ANTAGONISTS
CHAPTER
TONITRANEA REX’S TACTICS
During conflicts, the Tonitranea Rex uses its heightened mobility to disorient
opponents and take them down. This gigantic arthropod is made up of three parts,
each with its own profile: the Head, the Thorax with its long legs, and the massive
Abdomen covered with electrostatic spines. In order to defeat the creature, all three
must be reduced to 0 Hit Points.
 On the first enemy turn of each round, if at least two opponents aren’t suffering
from slow, the Abdomen uses Paralyzing Silk against all opponents. Otherwise, if it
doesn’t have enough Mind Points or if it’s electrified, the Abdomen uses Trampling
Slam against as many random targets as possible (this causes the Thorax to stop
dangling and the Abdomen to stop being electrified).
 On the second enemy turn, the Thorax uses Predator Ascent to start dangling if it’s
an odd-numbered round, or Electrostatic Charge if it’s an even-numbered round. If
it doesn’t have enough Mind Points, it uses Lightning Claw against as many random
targets as possible.
 On the third enemy turn of each round, the Head uses Toxic Spit against a
random target.
 On the fourth enemy turn of each round, the Thorax acts again, using Lightning
Claw against as many random targets as possible.
Since Head, Thorax and Abdomen are all parts of the Tonitranea, each of them has
access to the Villain’s Ultima Points pool, with two caveats:
 If one part spends 1 Ultima Point to recover from all status effects and recover 50
Mind Points, all parts gain these benefits.
 If one part spends 1 Ultima Point to Escape from the scene, all parts escape
immediately together.
If engaged while on the hunt, the Tonitranea Rex uses Ultima Points to Invoke a
Trait every time it misses one or more targets in Crisis, but always keeps 1 Ultima
Point to Escape to its lair. If engaged within the lair, however, the creature spends
Ultima Points more liberally and uses them to activate the Survival Instinct special
rule (see Thorax).

OTHER ACTIONS
S Electrostatic Charge w The Thorax can use an action and spend 10 Mind Points to rub its
back legs along the Abdomen, creating an electrostatic cloud. If it does, the Abdomen (see
page 178) becomes electrified.
S Predator Ascent w The Thorax can use an action and spend 10 Mind Points to climb up the
webs and become dangling until it suffers fire damage, ice damage, or damage of a type it
is Vulnerable to; the Thorax also stops dangling after the Abdomen (see page 178) uses
Trampling Slam. As long as the Thorax is dangling, no part of the Tonitranea Rex (Abdomen,
Head and Thorax) can be targeted with melee attacks unless the attacker is flying or able to
target flying creatures.
SPECIAL RULES
Limb w The Thorax is immune to dazed, enraged and shaken.
Survival Instinct w At the end of each round, if the Tonitranea Rex is within its lair and the
Abdomen and/or the Head are at 0 Hit Points, the Thorax must spend 1 Ultima Point to gather
its strength and bring both parts back into the scene, each with a number of Hit Points equal to
their Crisis value, but suffering from no status effects and at full Mind Points.
HANDLING THE PARTS OF THE TONITRANEA REX
Although the various parts of this Villain have individual profiles, in narrative terms
they are actually a single entity: for this reason, when one is reduced to 0 Hit Points
and/or leaves the conflict, they should be described as grievously wounded or
exhausted, not dead. At the same time, their senses are based on the Tonitranea Rex
as a whole (for example, defeating the Head does not impair the “sight” of the other
parts, which can target their opponents normally).
“Listen to me, lass, stay away from that creature: lightning
will reach you long before you hear the Lord of Thunder.”
180
W
MULTI-PART OPPONENTS
Tonitranea Rex is built according to an idea common to both JRPGs and beat ’em up
games: a boss that appears as a single body, but with a variety of minor parts that
can be targeted and damaged individually, to destroy, stun, or immobilize them for a
certain amount of time.
This method offers a number of advantages:
 It safeguards the value of multi-target abilities; those same abilities would otherwise
be wasted against a solitary champion-rank enemy.
 It prevents the battle from becoming too long, since the number of enemies goes
down bit by bit when the various parts are reduced to 0 Hit Points.
 It provides a lot more personality to enemies with a monstrous anatomy, making
each section of their bodies a mini-opponent that supports or synergizes with the
others, and these interactions show the nature, instincts, and habits of said creature.
 It allows the Game Master to add regeneration rules that set the pace of the conflict
and push the Players to make significant tactical decisions: do they want to eliminate
the more aggressive secondary parts first, knowing that they might come back later?
Or do they focus on the main body?
As a rule of thumb, an opponent built according to this logic includes:
 Main body. An elite or champion rank NPC that, usually, has support abilities and
an action or special rule that allows it to bring the other parts back into the scene
(usually when the main body enters Crisis for the first time or at a set point each
round). Sometimes (but not always!), defeating the main body causes the remaining
parts to immediately leave the conflict.
 Parts. Each section of the creature that plays a pivotal role in their tactics has a separate
profile, usually of soldier rank. Some parts are built for offense (such as the head of a
dragon, a robot’s ventral turret, or a manticore’s spiked tail) and others for defense (such
as an energy barrier generator, a claw shielding the body, or a floating ring).
In most instances, the ideal composition is a champion rank main body which replaces
a number of soldiers equal to the PCs on the scene minus 1, accompanied by two
soldier rank parts. However, as usual, you shouldn’t be afraid to experiment. The
following page presents some ideas to play with!

CHAPTER
9 ANCIENT ROBOT
The outer shell of this complex adversary is the Armor (soldier) with high Defenses
and Hit Points, flanked by two Armaments (soldier) that are more fragile, but
capable of unleashing attacks and spells. Inside, there is a Core (elite), completely
invulnerable as long as the Armor is on the scene, which creates a new Armament at
the end of each round if there are less than two. Both the initial Armaments and the
new ones are chosen at random from a six-option list, each with different Affinities
and offensive capabilities. If the Core is reduced to 0 Hit Points, the entire robot
deactivates immediately.
9 MAGMASAUR
This opponent consists of a Body (elite), a Head (elite) and a powerful Tail (soldier).
The Tail attacks with large swipes and can even inflict a status effect, but it can’t be
regenerated if defeated; the Head can cause grievous injuries with its bite and flaming
breath; and finally, the Body strikes with sharp claws or, if in Crisis, a powerful body
slam. Also, at the end of each round, if the Head is defeated but not the Body, the Head
returns to the scene with Hit Points equal to its Crisis value. The same happens to the
Body if it’s defeated while the Head is still up and running.
9 STORM SPIRIT
In contrast to the previous examples, this opponent consist of three parts of the same
rank: the Essence of Lightning (soldier) that uses electric attacks and spells, the
Essence of Air (soldier) that inflict status effects like slow or weak, and the Essence
of Water (soldier) that heals the other parts’ Hit Points and Mind Points. These three
Essences balance each other out, but when one is defeated, the remaining Essences
become more powerful, doubling their maximum and current Hit Points, not to
mention their number of turns starting from the next round!

NODE AND DYLON
W
Born and raised in the lake village of Turva, Node and Dylon have been inseparable
since birth: together, the young human and the sea tiger learned how to sail the
narrow canals, swim against the current, and survive among the waters. Side by side,
they became the most respected pair of hunters in the village, protecting it from
dangers, delivering letters and messages to the settlements of nearby regions, and
obtaining food, medicines, and other resources.
Everything changed during a particularly long hunting trip, when a ravenous and
overgrown eelfang attacked their group: miraculously escaping the carnage, the two
hunters developed a grudge against the beast, despite the warning of their old mentor,
Stelarcte, and her stern exhortation to remember the souls of the fallen without
bringing further torment to them. The duo left Turva for many months, trained hard
and finally faced and killed the beast, exacting their revenge.
Alas, awaiting their return was a gruesome silence: the village had been reduced to
ashes, destroyed by a migrating lava beast. Node and Dylon came to a grim realization:
a world populated by monsters of such power would never be safe for humanity, and
the only way to save as many lives as possible was to preemptively hunt down and kill
these creatures. None but them can bear such a burden but, as always, having each
other to rely upon will be enough.

Node and Dylon add an environmental effect to every conflict they take part in, the

them is in Crisis; as soon as either of them is in Crisis, the tide becomes low.
 On the first enemy turn of each round, Node uses Hunting Horn if he has enough
Mind Points and hasn’t used it so far. Otherwise, he uses Hunter’s Bow, prioritizing
targets suffering from weak (during high tide) or slow (during low tide).
 On the second enemy turn, Dylon uses Rock Toss against a random target. If he doesn’t
have enough Mind Points he uses Sea Fin against a random target.
 On the third enemy turn, Node acts again, using Net Throw against as many random
targets as possible, prioritizing those suffering from weak during high tide.
 On the fourth enemy turn, Dylon uses Coordinated Action, prioritizing enemies
suffering from weak. Node’s free attack (during high tide) targets a random enemy
instead. If Dylon doesn’t have enough Mind Points, he uses Sea Fin instead, always
prioritizing weak targets.
Node and Dylon are friends who share every aspect of their lives: for this reason they
have a single pool of Ultima Points and each can spend them to Invoke a Trait or
Recover; if one spends an Ultima Point to Escape, both leave the scene safely.
The goal of this rule is to highlight how deep the symbiosis and harmony of this duo
run, creating a stark contrast with the mission they undertook: they are clearly able to
show care and tenderness, but they decided to discard these feelings when looking
at one of their preys.
During the first conflict with the Player Characters, Node and Dylon don’t see them as
worthy opponents, but rather as naive and headstrong people that don’t understand
the importance of their mission: as such, they spend Ultima Points to Recover only
when suffering from 3 or more status effects, and they always keep 1 Ultima Point to
Escape as soon as one of them is reduced to 0 Hit Points (ignore the I’ll Avenge You!
special rules).
In subsequent battles, however, they consider the PCs a grave danger to their mission
and spend Ultima Points to Invoke a Trait every time they fail a Check.

Low Tide Speed w When the tide is low, all damage dealt to Node by creatures suffering from
slow is reduced by 5 (before applying Affinities).
THE TIDE AND FLOW OF THE BATTLE
Node and Dylon’s special mechanic is the tide: this kind of additional rule is excellent
to add “phases” to a conflict without tying them to a specific adversary. It’s also an
interesting way to add a back-and-forth pace to the scene, to reveal something about
the enemies’ personality, and to ensure they can’t benefit from all their skills at the
same time, which could make them too overwhelming or frustrating. The best way to
keep track of these effects is a physical reminder, like a coin to flip or a card to rotate
(this last prop can easily represent a cycle of four phases, for example).

A REFLECTION IN TWO PARTS
While the Tonitranea Rex (see page 176) is a terrible predator that upsets the
ecosystem, Node and Dylon showcase how pain and tragedy might warp protective
instincts into extremism – a preemptive and short-sighted hunt, fueled by fear
rather than understanding. However, the village of Turva and their mentor cultivated
a diametrically opposite philosophy, one that still endures in the powerful bond
between Node and Dylon: it’s not too late, and the Player Characters might be able to
bring those feelings back to surface before they drown in a sea of bitterness.

BRIGHTVALE
W
Legends say that once upon a time, at the foot of a mountain in the Northlands, there
was a village called Brightvale, because of its verdant territory and favorable climate.
The people of the village were united, kind, welcoming, and loved life above all else –
in fact, they were healthy and very long-lived.
However, this longevity made every bereavement excruciating: the villagers would
cry and try to comfort each other as the faint light of the Funerary Lantern guided the
procession. Both the living and the dead only wished to be able to remain with their
loved ones forever, and this is how some souls managed to find a way back, guided
by the Lantern itself. The people thought it was a miracle, unaware of the looming
danger: in order to remain among the living against the natural order of things, those
spirits were consuming the life of their loved ones.
As more and more people died, just as many spirits joined the village. And year after
year, those souls gradually forgot who they were, until they became faint presences,
attracted like moths to the light of the Lantern. In the end, they turned into pale
flames thirsting for life. Eventually, the spirits overtook the village, and Brightvale
itself – now the epicentre of this warping of the natural order – was reborn as a
terrible serpentine monstrosity that withers everything it touches, constantly chasing
the Lantern that the naive villagers put all their faith into.

Major Villain (10 Ultima Points); Champion 3 (worth 3 soldiers)
BRIGHTVALE’S TACTICS: PHASE 1
The battle with Brightvale is divided in two parts. During the first, the heroes have
to climb the lengthy Back of Brightvale, trying to reach the head, while harassed
by Will-o-Wisps attracted by their life energy (at the start of the conflict there are
two Will-o-Wisps).
 On the first enemy turn of each round, the Back of Brightvale uses Compact Terrain
(if it is not in Crisis or already under its effect). Otherwise, if it has 40 or more Mind
Points, it uses Silent Recall, targeting as many Will-o-Wisps as possible, making them
shoot Pale Flame against random targets. If neither of these conditions is true, the
Back performs the Guard action instead (be aware that its effect lasts only until the
start of the Back’s next turn in this round).
 On the second enemy turn, the Back of Brightvale uses Unstable Ground against
two random targets.
 Then, all Will-o-Wisps present on the scene perform their turns, using Grave Whispers
against a random target, prioritizing those with the highest current Hit Points. If they
lack the Mind Points, they use Pale Flame against a random target instead.
 On the last enemy turn of the round, if it has enough Mind Points, the Back of
Brightvale uses Sandy Dive, otherwise it uses Stolen Strength.
 At the end of each round, if there are less than two Will-o-Wisps present on the
scene, a new Will-o-Wisp joins the conflict.
In this phase, the Back of Brightvale doesn’t use Ultima Points – from a certain point
of view, it hasn’t even noticed the characters yet.
When the Back reaches 0 Hit Points, the body of Brightvale breaks apart and the
gargantuan creature plummets to the ground. Now the heroes can move to the second
half of this battle, against the Head of Brightvale and the Funerary Lantern hanging
in front of it (see page 190).
We encourage you to give the Player Characters one round of free actions to catch
their breath and get ready for the next part of the battle.
The conflict scene does not end and it’s not necessary to roll initiative again, but all
remaining Will-o-Wisps fade away, leaving the scene.

Each target may perform a free attack with a weapon they have equipped (or a basic attack, if
the target is an NPC). If they do, treat the High Roll as 0 when calculating damage.
OTHER ACTIONS
S Sandy Dive w The Back of Brightvale can use an action and spend 20 Mind Points to dive
under the desert sand and suddenly reemerge. If it does, all enemies present on the scene
have to perform a Group Check【 INS + MIG】 with DL 10. If the Group Check fails, the Back
deals 15 earth damage to each enemy it can see, and those enemies also suffer shaken.
S Stolen Strength w The Back of Brightvale can use an action to steal energy from the shattered
souls that surround it. If it does, each Will-o-Wisp on the scene loses 20 Hit Points; then, the
Back of Brightvale recovers 20 Mind Points for each Will-o-Wisp that lost Hit Points this way.
SPECIAL RULES
Construct w The Back of Brightvale is immune to poisoned.
Sand and Dust w At the end of each of its turns, if the Back of Brightvale is in Crisis, it loses
10 Hit Points as its body slowly falls apart. If it reaches 0 Hit Points this way, all of its enemies

Parasitic Flame w When one or more enemies recover Mind Points, they regain only half the
normal amount and each Will-o-Wisp recovers 999 Mind Points (if there are two or more Willo-
Wisps on the scene, this effect triggers only once).
Undead w The Will-o-Wisp is immune to poisoned and HP recovery may harm it (see Core
Rulebook, page 305).
UNDEAD OPPONENTS IN NATURAL FANTASY
Clinging to life so fiercely that one becomes undead is a classic of the high fantasy
genre: ancient warlocks becoming abominable liches, entire spectral armies forced by
ancient oaths to emerge from their graves, and so on. Brightvale frames this idea in a
natural fantasy context, adding a touch of horror – the love of a steadfast community
turned to unhealthy attachment and misfortune. This opponent doesn’t have any evil
plan or grand ambitions, it lacks even a real conscience – it’s considered a Villain
because it embodies the villagers’ fear and refusal to accept the natural order of life.
“Nothing remains of those ancient lands.
Only sand, silence and a pale light far, far away.”

W
BRIGHTVALE’S TACTICS (PHASE 2)
The heroes must now face what is left of the souls of the villagers, still tied to the
world of the living by the pale light of the Funerary Lantern.
 On the first enemy turn of each round, the Head of Brightvale resolves Unnatural
Presence, then uses Gravesand Jaws against a random target.
 On the second enemy turn, if it has less than 30 Mind Points, the Head spends 1
Ultima Point to recover, otherwise it uses Dust to Dust against a random target.
 On the third enemy turn, the Lantern uses Follow Me… against a PC that is not under
its effect yet, prioritizing those with the highest current Might. If it lacks the required
Mind Points, it uses Dim Light against random targets.
 On the fourth enemy turn, if it has enough Mind Points, the Head uses Ancient
Desires, otherwise it uses Gravesand Jaws against a random target.
In this phase, the Head of Brightvale doesn’t spend Ultima Points as long as the
Lantern is lit – but when it becomes extinguished, the Head spends them liberally to
strike its opponents.

TITANIA, QUEEN OF FAIRIES
W
Many legends tell how dangerous it is to strike a deal with fairies, the ancient beings
who rule the woods of the shire. And with good reason. It’s not their cunning, nor their
knack of twisting every word to their own desires that makes them so fearsome; no,
their most terrible weapon is time itself. Mortals age and die, and their descendants
often forget the ancient oaths or turn them into mere tales. But the fairy beings are
untouched by the flow of the years and, if someone denies them their due, their fury
is inextinguishable.
The villagers of Frosthill struck one such deal with Titania, the Queen of Fairies: every
year, the Queen would grant plentiful crops and peaceful pastures but, in exchange,
the inhabitants had to gift them three seeds from their favorite peach tree. For three
generations the villagers kept their word, but gradually forgot the true meaning of the
ceremony, until they eventually disregarded it completely. And so the fury of the Queen
struck them down, causing the flora of the same fields and pastures they had nurtured
for years to grow beyond measure. This created a gigantic plant maze that has held
the inhabitants hostage ever since, for the amusement of the fairy court. It’s a magical
domain, where day, night, and climate answer to Queen’s every whim.

CHAPTER
THE QUEEN OF FAIRIES
Titania is an atypical antagonist who might assume one of two symmetrical forms,
the Queen of Midday or the Queen of Midnight, alongside their corresponding
mischievous court.
 If the characters challenge Titania, the fae monarch enters the fray as the Queen of
Midday, accompanied by two Sun Poppies.
 When reduced to 0 Hit Points in either form, Titania uses the Dawn or Dusk special rule
(see upcoming pages) to assume their opposite form.
 After each shift, Titania is considered a new creature in terms of rules, with full Hit Points
and Mind Points, and no lingering status effects. Any and all spells that affected the other
form end, and any symbol (see High Fantasy Atlas, page 148) is removed. It’s possible to
steal from them twice using Soul Steal (see Core Rulebook, page 203), once per form.
From the perspective of Titania and their court, our heroes are a form of entertainment,
so a sacrifice is not available in this conflict, but it is possible to perform some deeds
to gain the favor of the court (the amount of favor granted is shown in brackets in the
list below). The Game Master has to reveal this information as soon as someone fulfills a
deed but the full list must be kept secret. Each deed provides favor only once.
 Combo Breaker (+1). Titania cannot perform any action during their turn.
 Fourth Wall (+1). A Player (yes, a Player, not a character!) makes Titania laugh.
 Inconceivable! (+1). A PC wins an Opposed Check where Titania uses the bonus of
Aspect of the Queen or Aspect of the Huntress.
 Insubordination (+1). A character with the Outcast Fairy Quirk (see page 125) causes
one of Titania’s forms to enter Crisis.
 Look Out, My Queen! (+1). A character uses the Protect Skill (see Core Rulebook,
page 197) to shield Titania from danger.
 One Hundred to Zero (+1). A PC reduces an opponent from maximum HP to 0 HP.
 To Persist is Human (+1). Titania has used both Weird Mind and Eternal Body.
 What a Boom! (+1). A PC brings two or more opponents to 0 HP in a single turn.
 Planned Defeat (+2). One Player Character surrenders.
 Spirit of the Underdog (+2). Titania has reached 0 Hit Points once in each form.
If the PCs accumulate 6 or more favor, Titania loses all their Ultima Points and the
conflict ends: the Queen is now willing to negotiate with the group.

Millennia ago, the great forest of Eldgren gracefully welcomed those who proved
themselves worthy of its favor: after overcoming the tests imposed by the guardian
spirits, worthy mortals received the great tree’s blessings, so that entities dwelling in
the earth, the stone, among the branches, and in the streams would heed their words
and prayers.
Unfortunately, an ancient civilization, whose erudition was matched only by their
fear of the unknown, decided that these superstitions were obsolete and dangerous,
that such a power had to be grasped and controlled. They started many wars, but left
precious few accounts. The forest was reduced to a smoldering waste, but even less
remained of those short-sighted people.
However, the spirits never left their home: over the centuries, they healed the earth
and new life blossomed in Eldgren. The superficial wounds were mended, but the rage
and the resentment for the mortals’ actions still burned in the depths, like buried
embers, slowly poisoning the heart of the forest, and allowing an invisible parasite to
make its nest within it.
When young humans, oblivious to what had transpired, set foot among the trees
once again, Eldgren remained silent, waiting.
When some of them pushed deeper, studying the broken ruins of those ancient
people, Eldgren waited.
But when the first trees were felled, the spirits decided that these mortals were
the same as their ancestors and, if left unchecked, the tragedies of the past would
repeat themselves.
Ash swept away, embers roar hateful once again: the ancient guardians of the forest
are ablaze with a ghostly and vengeful fire, while millennia-old trees entwine their
branches and shake the ground to uproot the human threat once and for all… even at
the cost of snuffing out hundreds.
Not all is lost: a minuscule fragment of Eldgren’s ancient heart managed to escape
desperation and traveled beyond the boundaries of the forest, looking for heroes who
can heal its suffering…
“What do you know about pain? Of suffering?
Your ancestors committed unforgivable crimes.
You will be given no chance to repeat them!”

THE FOREST’S TRIAL
In this first phase, the characters delve into the forest, hoping to stop it before it
unleashes its rage on nearby villages.
From a narrative perspective, the last non-corrupted shard of the heart of the forest
guided the PCs here. The shard might be an NPC, but it would be better if they are
a Player Character who has remembered the true nature of their mission. Such a
revelation might be triggered with a Fabula Point or with a Quirk like Underchild
(see page 129), or introduced by the awakening of the Mysterious Grimoire Quirk (see
page 124). Another interesting option is the revelation that a PC’s Faithful Companion
(see Core Rulebook, page 217) is much more than a common animal.
In this phase, the forest is an environmental element, it doesn’t take part in the conflict
nor use any Ultima Points. The main threat is the Ashen Rådande (see page 201), who
hinder the heroes while they undertake the ancient trials of Eldgren.
The trials take place at the end of each round, in the following order:
 Trial of Strength (first round). Each PC must perform a【 MIG + WLP】 Check with
Difficulty Level 10. For each success, the group accrue 1 Trial Point, but those who
fail lose half of their current Hit Points.
 Trial of Remembrance (second round). Each PC can choose one of their Bonds
and give it to the Forest; that Bond cannot be invoked until the end of the scene.
Each PC who chooses to give one of their Bonds must recount one campaign event
linked to it, and then roll their highest base Attribute die, adding the strength
of the gifted Bond, accruing 1 Trial Point, plus another one if the result is 10 or
higher. Each PC that doesn’t give a Bond fails the trial and becomes coveted by the
Rådande until the end of the Scene.
 Trial of Unity (third round). Each PC rolls their lowest base Attribute die. If the result
is equal to or lower than that PC’s total number of Bonds, the group accrue 1 Trial
Point. If the result is higher, the PC loses half of their current Mind Points.
At the end of the fourth round, if the group has accrued a number of Trial Points equal
to or higher than【 the number of Player Characters, multiplied by 3】, the ancestral
magic recognizes their valor and brings them before the Ancient (see page 202).
Otherwise, a strange spell drops them at the edge of the forest and they will be able
to face the Ancient only later; meanwhile, Eldgren will have started rampaging across
the countryside.

SPECIAL RULES
Harrowing Rage w As long as the Ashen Rådande is poisoned, all damage they deal ignores
Immunities and Resistances.
Plant w The Ashen Rådande is immune to dazed, enraged, and shaken.
Trial by Fire w When the Ashen Rådande is reduced to 0 Hit Points, Player Characters receive
1 Trial Point.
ASHEN RÅDANDE TACTICS
At the start of the conflict, a number of Rådande equal to the number of PCs minus
1 enter the scene. The forest spirits’ grudge drives them to push intruders away,
preventing them from even attempting to demonstrate that they are worthy of
Eldgren’s trust and respect.
On their turn, if they are not poisoned, a Rådande uses Shared Torment against a
random target, prioritizing those who are not poisoned already. If poisoned, the
Rådande uses Fan the Flames against a random target, prioritizing coveted ones.
Also, every time a Player Character fails one of the three trials of the spirits, another
Rådande immediately joins the conflict (up to a maximum number of Rådande equal
to how many were present at the start of the conflict).
Major Villain (10 Ultima Points); Variable rank (see below)

ELDGREN’S TACTICS: THE ANCIENT
At this point, the PCs have to face Eldgren in all her rage, under the guise of the
ancient and colossal guardian of the forest: a towering wooden colossus, similar to a
giant moose with blazing antlers.
This conflict can either immediately follow the trials (described in the previous pages)
or occur later on if the characters failed the trials or didn’t reach the forest before it
animated and began its march of destruction. In the first case, you should make sure
that the PCs have enough time to reorganize and use potions or other abilities to
regain strength; in the second, if the group took a really long time to arrive, this battle
might include a Clock representing the progressive destruction of a settlement or a
region, automatically filling by one section at the end of each round.
In the form of the Ancient, Eldgren is powerful and unrelenting, but quite predictable.
 On her first turn of each round, if two or less PCs are enraged, Eldgren uses Rekindle
the Embers, otherwise, she uses Scorching Gaze against a random target. If she
doesn’t have enough Mind Points, she uses Ashen Antlers against a random target.
 On her second turn, Eldgren uses Toxic Despair against as many random targets as
possible, prioritizing those already poisoned.
 In the third turn, Eldgren uses Scorching Gaze against a random target; if she doesn’t
have enough Mind Points, she spends 1 Ultima Point to Recover.
 On her fourth turn, Eldgren uses Ashen Antlers against a random target.
 On her fifth turn, Eldgren uses Thousand-year Fury against the enemy toward which
she bears a grudge. If she doesn’t have a grudge against anyone, she attacks a
random target with Ashen Antlers instead.
In this phase, Eldgren spends Ultima Points to Invoke a Trait every time she fails a
Magic Check to cast one of her offensive spells, or to Recover during her third turn.
Once reduced to 0 Hit Points, the Ancient collapses to the ground and stops moving,
leaving the Heart of the Forest exposed (see page 204).

BASIC ATTACKS
$ Ashen Antlers w【 MIG + MIG】 +4 w【 HR + 20】 fire damage. If Eldgren bears a grudge this
attack deals 5 extra damage. If this attack misses while Eldgren bears a grudge, she loses 30
Hit Points after resolving the attack.
a Toxic Despair w【 INS + MIG】 +4 w【 HR + 15】 poison damage. This attack has multi (2). If a

OTHER ACTIONS
S Thousand-year Fury w Eldgren may use an action to deal 30 damage to the creature toward
which she bears a grudge, plus 10 extra damage for every other time she has used this action
since the start of the scene. Then, Eldgren stops bearing her grudge. Damage dealt by this
action has no type and thus ignores Affinities.
SPECIAL RULES
Ancestral Grudge w When an opponent causes Eldgren to lose Hit Points, she starts bearing
a grudge toward them. She can bear only one grudge at a time. If Eldgren recovers Hit Points
while bearing a grudge, instead she recovers no Hit Points and stops bearing a grudge.
Misery w Eldgren is immune to poisoned. As long as there are two or more creatures suffering from
poisoned present on the scene, Eldgren may treat her Defense and Magic Defense scores as being
equal to 13.
Plant w Eldgren is immune to dazed, enraged, and shaken.

present on the scene suffer poisoned.
Tough Grudge w As long as she bears a grudge, Eldgren is Immune to all damage types except
air and earth.

In this phase, the characters are face-to-face with the pulsing Heart of the Forest, and
at last they have the chance to heal it, removing the mysterious and invisible parasite
that infested it.
This conflict is based upon a special rule designed to showcase the narrative through
the game mechanics:
The Heart enters the scene with current Hit Points equal to 1 and its Hit Points cannot
go below 1. If the Heart’s current Hit Points become equal to or greater than 480, it
loses all Ultima Points and Surrenders immediately.
This scene also includes a “Slumbering Hope” Clock with 4 sections, visible to all
participants. This Clock can be filled or emptied only in the following ways:
 When a Player Character present on the scene spends 1 Fabula Point to invoke a
Theme of Belonging, Hope, Justice or Mercy, fill 1 section of the Clock.
 At the start of the fourth enemy turn (see below) of the round, if the Clock is full,
empty it. If you do, the Heart regains 40 Hit Points and 40 Mind Points, and it doesn’t
perform any action this turn.
ELDGREN’S TACTICS: THE HEART OF THE FOREST
The Heart follows a very strict cycle of play:
 On the first enemy turn, the Heart uses Flame of Remembrance during oddnumbered
rounds or Avenging Miasma during even-numbered rounds, both against
random targets.
 On the second enemy turn, if it has enough Mind Points, the Heart uses Aura
of Desperation during odd-numbered rounds, or Ashen Breath during evennumbered
rounds. If it lacks the required Mind Points, it uses Avenging Miasma
against random targets.
 On the third enemy turn, the Heart uses Ancient Vitality or, if it doesn’t have enough
Mind Points, a Recovery action. If it doesn’t have any Ultima Points left, it uses Flame
of Remembrance against a random target.
 On the fourth enemy turn, check the “Slumbering Hope” Clock (see above). If the
Clock isn’t empty and the Heart is not in Crisis, it uses Parasite Grasp. If the Heart is
in Crisis and/or it doesn’t have enough Mind Points, it uses Flame of Remembrance
against a random target.

BASIC ATTACKS
$ Flame of Remembrance w【 INS + MIG】 +7 w【 HR + 15】 fire damage. After resolving this
attack, if the Accuracy Check’s High Roll was even, the Heart regains 20 Hit Points, otherwise,
it loses 20 Hit Points.

h Aura of Desperation w 20 MP w Special w Instantaneous.
Every creature able to see the Heart suffers shaken.
h Parasite Grasp w 30 MP w Special w Instantaneous.
The mysterious infection nestled in the Heart of Eldgren spreads, causing it to spasm
violently: the Heart loses the exact amount of Hit Point required to enter Crisis. After that,
the Heart deals poison damage equal to【 the amount of Hit Points lost with this spell
divided by the number of creatures present on the scene】 to each creature present on the
scene (including itself).
If a Player Character learns this spell with spell Mimic (see Core Rulebook, page 183), they
immediately lose all their Fabula Points and suffer enraged. If the campaign continues, the
group might even have that character evolve into a Villain, infected by the parasite.
OTHER ACTIONS
S Ancestral Vitality w The Heart may use an action and spend 20 Mind Points to stop being
affected by any spell with duration “Scene” and any “hex” invocations (see page 156).
SPECIAL RULES
Parasitic Despair w As long as it is not in Crisis, the Heart is treated as having neutral Affinity
(-) to all types of damage.
Plant w The Heart is immune to dazed, enraged, and shaken.
