CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Welcome to Fabula Ultima!
What you hold in your hands is the core rulebook for a tabletop roleplaying game
inspired by some of the most beloved JRPG videogames, such as Bravely Default,
Bravely Second, Chrono Trigger, Dragon Quest, Granblue Fantasy, Legend of Dragoon,
Ni No Kuni, Octopath Traveler, The Legend of Heroes, the Tales of series, and the
legendary Final Fantasy series.
The JRPG acronym stands for Japanese (or Japanese-style) Roleplaying Game, a
videogame genre that saw its origin in Japan but is currently spread all over the world,
counting hundreds of titles.
JRPG videogames share some major elements: they tell fantastic stories in which
extraordinary individuals confront the darkness that threatens their world, growing
and learning to trust each other: only by struggling together and casting aside their
suspicions and differences will they save what they hold dear. This may read like a
reasonably common premise, but what makes JRPGs unique is that the worlds in which
they are set — often wondrous and bizarre! — are built around the protagonists and act
as a reflection of the doubts, hopes and feelings driving their actions: the process of
discovering the setting goes hand in hand with understanding who is accompanying
us in our journeys.
 Just like the JRPGs it was inspired by, Fabula Ultima focuses on epic tales of growing
heroes and powerful villains, set in fantastic worlds brimming with wondrous
locations and bizarre, unique monsters, tightly connected to each protagonist's
unique themes and choices.
 Unlike a videogame, you won't play through a prewritten plot and grind for experience
by slaying monsters for countless hours or carrying out duties for quest-givers.
Instead, you will build your own story together little by little, and you will be rewarded
for playing your character in a way that fits their role and identity in that story!

A ROLEPLAYING GAME
Roleplaying games (abbreviated RPGs) are a particular type of game — they
originated as tabletop games, but are nowadays often played online as well.
In a roleplaying game, a group of people play together to create a story: they do so by
talking with each other, and that conversation is accompanied by the use of rules and
(typically) dice rolls, which help determine the outcome of uncertain situations and
guarantee that the story created reflects the premises of the game — tension and fear
for a horror game, adrenaline scenes for an action game, deep and heartfelt character
interaction for a romantic game, and so on.
In Japan, this activity is also known as a "table talk role-playing game" (TTRPG),
specifically, because it relies so heavily on the conversation at the table.
d ROLES IN THE GAME
The people who play this game will fulfill different roles:
 One person will be the Game Master. Often abbreviated as GM, this person's role
is that of portraying the game world in which the protagonists of the story act and
live. As the protagonists establish goals and make choices, the Game Master will
challenge those goals and describe the consequences of their actions.
You can find more about the Game Master's role on page 26!
 Everyone else will be a Player. Each of the remaining participants — two to five
people — will create a heroic protagonist and then control that character's actions
within the game world. Each protagonist is known as a Player Character, generally
abbreviated as PC.
Characters that are controlled by the Game Master, on the other hand, are called Non-
Player Characters, or NPCs.
You can find more about each Player's role on page 24!
While it is true that the role of the Game Master is to present obstacles and put the
Player Characters in situations of risk and danger, their role is not that of an adversary,
but rather someone who aims to make the protagonists shine throughout the story.
There is no "win condition" in this game: as long as you create a memorable story and
enjoy each other's company, you're all winning.

INTRODUCTION

W
CHAPTER d THE BASICS OF PLAY
In the conversation, Players describe their characters' actions and choices:
"Isabelle raises her shield and guards your back!"
"I step forward and speak to the queen!"
"I run after the thief! Where did he go?"
Similarly, the Game Master describes what happens in the world and also portrays the
actions of every creature and character around the protagonists:
"The village looks calm, its white windmills turning lazily under the sun."
"The king appears tired and struggles to speak, as if not in control of his body."
"The dragon turns his smoldering gaze towards you!"
Together, this is all known as roleplaying, and these events will take place in your
imagination — a space that is often called "the fiction".
d THE RULES
This is also a game, and that's where the rules come into play: much like in a video
game or board game, characters have scores and abilities representing their strengths
and weaknesses, and dice rolls will often be used to make a situation's outcome a bit
tense and unpredictable.
Unlike video games and board games however, the possibilities of a roleplaying game
are endless: there is no single approach to a situation and the story will naturally
emerge from your interactions and choices at the table.
This is a tale of heroes and darkness.
Of great hope... and even greater sacrifice.

W
BUT WHAT IS THIS GAME ABOUT?
There are many roleplaying games in the world, and we play them for different
reasons: many make us feel like heroes, some have us embroiled in dark investigations
and tragic tales, others will challenge our skills and tactical mindset, and others make
us reflect on heavy and important topics.
Fabula Ultima was designed to be a TTJRPG — a Table Talk JRPG, evoking the feel
and stories that can typically be found in classic console Japanese roleplaying video
games.
d HEROIC AND FANTASTIC ACTION
In line with the genre that inspired it, this game doesn't concern itself with realism
or verisimilitude — instead, it deliberately embraces a light-hearted, bizarre and
"videogamey" feel, both in its tone and in its mechanics.
d A GAME OF HEROES AND VILLAINS
This is a game about larger-than-life heroes and tragic antagonists. There is no
predetermined plot, scenario, or "adventure" — the heroes' actions, motivations, and
objectives will drive the story forward while the Game Master reacts to their choices
and places obstacles on their path, often in the form of powerful villains with their
own devious agendas, which will change time and time again as the protagonists
manage (or fail) to thwart their plans.
d HEROIC DESTINY
The heroes of Fabula Ultima are destined to accomplish great deeds, and they will
only meet their end when the person who plays them deems it appropriate.
That said, the price of defeat will often prove steeper than death — a major part of this
game will be discovering how your heroes rise from their failures and learn to work
together in order to accomplish what they could never do on their own.

CHAPTER
d CHALLENGING BATTLES
Combat in Fabula Ultima is reminiscent of the console games that inspired it — each
character will have a few tricks up their sleeve, and only by properly combining clever
tactics and coordinating with your allies will you emerge victorious... especially when
fighting against bosses!
d YOUR WORLD
Fabula Ultima has no default or "canonical" world, and that's on purpose! Your group
will collaboratively create a custom world in which your tales will take place.
That said, the world and characters you create must adhere to eight core principles,
known as the Eight Pillars — which you can find on the next page!
On the other hand, if you're not familiar with the classic tropes of Japanese console
roleplaying games, you can find a useful collection of inspirational worlds starting on
page 16!
"There is more than one side to each story..."
14
W
THE EIGHT PILLARS
The world in which your adventures will take place is not predetermined: its cities,
kingdoms, deities, and cultures are something your group will create (take a look at
World Creation on page 148). This fantastic land will grow organically as you explore
and travel across it, adding new details and unraveling ancient mysteries!
What ties all Fabula Ultima worlds together are The Eight Pillars.
ANCIENT RUINS AND HARSH LANDS
The world is an ancient and dangerous place: cities and villages are separated by vast
plains, scorching deserts, frozen peaks and impenetrable forests. The land is dotted
with crumbling fortresses and shrines devoted to deities whose names have been lost
to time. Past civilizations and ages of darkness have left behind a world of powerful
artifacts and cryptic legends, as well as magical (and often dangerous) places.
A WORLD IN PERIL
Villages, castles, and city-states are among the few areas that aren’t literally crawling
with monsters, brigands, and hostile creatures. Far more dangerous still are Villains,
powerful antagonists casting their shadow over the entire land. Cruel sorcerers, evil
gods seeking reincarnation, power-hungry emperors, perhaps even alien entities:
there’s a single, unspeakable terror behind the dangers of the world, and our heroes
are bound to cross its path sooner or later.
CLASHING COMMUNITIES
The world may be in danger, but its inhabitants are still divided by ancient grudges:
religious schisms, memories of war crimes, and the conflict between magic and science
are among the most common causes of enmity. Reuniting these communities will
be key to defeating the great evils of the world; the protagonists should help them
overcome their hostilities and see their differences as blessings instead of obstacles.
EVERYTHING HAS A SOUL
All matter that forms the world, including its creatures, the earth, sky, sun, and stars
are part of a vast flow of spiritual energy. The origin, nature, and function of this
energy may vary depending on the world you create, but its presence is undeniable
and anyone possessing the ability to manipulate it (be it through magic or science) is
a force to be reckoned with.
1
INTRODUCTION
15
W
CHAPTER MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY
In every Fabula Ultima world, science and magic represent two different ways of
studying and manipulating reality: one concerns itself with the tangible nature of
matter, the other with the souls that dwell within it — two sides of the same coin.
Miraculous machinery might be hidden beneath the ruins of an ancient civilization,
and even the most powerful wizards will often make use of vehicles and airships.
Many of these worlds also feature an unusual discipline that combines magic and
technology into magitech: metal soldiers animated by the souls of the fallen, bombs
that can unleash elemental mayhem, and flying machines fueled by wind spirits are
only a few examples of what can be created by this hybrid craft.
HEROES OF MANY SIZES AND SHAPES
Fabula Ultima’s protagonists are full-fledged heroes, extraordinary individuals that
possess unique abilities and whose actions will shape the fate of the world. While
some may not be noble paladins or virtuous paragons of justice, even the thieves and
dark knights among them have a fundamentally good nature and can be trusted to do
the right thing when the situation gets desperate.
In line with the video game genre Fabula Ultima draws inspiration from, our heroes
do not follow any rule of realism: be they children with incredible magical powers or
elderly warriors able to single-handedly challenge an entire army, all that matters is
their strength of spirit.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HEROES
Any relevant event in a game of Fabula Ultima is tied to the heroes, either directly or
indirectly. Dramatic plot twists shall happen when the protagonists are present on the
scene, and the great powers (and evils) of the world shall pay them special attention.
Following the same logic, the heroes’ determination will allow them to achieve the
impossible, such as defeating an empire or sealing away a powerful deity.
MYSTERY, DISCOVERY, AND GROWTH
This game is built upon discovery: of ancient mysteries and forgotten powers, yes, but
most of all, of the heroes themselves, of their feelings, and of what they are willing to
do in order to fight against darkness. Fabula Ultima’s protagonists are complex and
sometimes tragic figures, and their journey will change them forever.

Great castles whose crystal spires reach the sky, fleets of ornate airships emerging
from the clouds, vast stretches of enchanted forests, and ancient, sprawling ruins
brimming with magical golems and powerful artifacts. A High Fantasy world is an
ageless classic and the perfect fit for your Fabula Ultima story.
d HIGH FANTASY THEMES AND PROTAGONISTS
High fantasy stories often revolve around themes such as hope, friendship, and fighting
together against supernatural and world-ending threats.
Their protagonists often come from many different backgrounds:
 The princess who lost her kingdom to the antagonist's army.
 The veteran soldier who pledged to protect the people with her life.
 The young, inexperienced hero from a remote village.
 The dashing sky pirate with a heart of gold.
 The old wizard mentor who spent his life searching for a legendary spell.
 The dark knight seeking redemption for his crimes.
Together they must overcome their differences and disagreements, forging strong
bonds that will allow them to save the world from a terrible fate.

CHAPTER
d HIGH FANTASY LOCATIONS
Every location in a high fantasy world has some magical element to it: a floating castle
inside a volcano, a silver palace orbiting the moon, a forest populated by fairies and
natural spirits, a great tower built to reach the gods and destroyed over a single night
as a form of divine punishment. Everything is bizarre and wondrous.
d HIGH FANTASY MAGIC
Magic is abundant, omnipresent, and employed in a variety of ways and by a variety
of people, from powerful court wizards to traveling healers. Golems, airships, and
elementally-infused weapons are a common sight. However, the most ancient and
world-altering rituals have been lost to time, hidden within sunken ruins or guarded
by centuries-old monsters.
d HIGH FANTASY ANTAGONISTS
In a high fantasy world, antagonists are larger-than-life figures with armies and
incredible magic at their disposal. Each of them is a dark and twisted reflection of one
or more of the protagonists: they are shadows that must be confronted for the heroes
to grow and eventually triumph. Towards the end of the story, driven into a corner by
the protagonists' actions, high fantasy villains often resort to extreme measures and
transform into divine or demonic entities that defy space and time.

Floating amidst a lush expanse of verdant forests, snow-capped mountains, and
crystal-clear lakes, small villages slumber peacefully, coexisting with the beasts and
elemental forces of the wilderness. Underneath it all lie the ruins of mysterious past
civilizations that once ruled this world of Natural Fantasy.
d NATURAL FANTASY THEMES AND PROTAGONISTS
Tales of natural fantasy often revolve around warmth and community, harmony with
nature and beasts, and the tragedy that befalls when the hearts of the people grow so
dark that they twist and corrupt the very places they live in.
Their protagonists are often very young and come from the same village:
 The daughter of the village chief, seeking to prove her worth.
 The apprentice blacksmith who saw a terrible creature in the forest.
 The young hermit who stumbled upon the entrance to a magical ruin.
 The witch who knows of a prophecy dating back to the Ancestors.
 The wandering warrior who mistakenly angered a local spirit.
Together they must mend the hearts of their community and confront those who stir
sentiments of hatred and mistrust, to prevent this darkness from corrupting the very
balance of the world around them.

CHAPTER
d NATURAL FANTASY LOCATIONS
In a natural fantasy world, every location and vista is deeply immersed in vibrant
colors and populated by great beasts and monsters. There are no cities and roads, only
small villages and narrow paths. But as our heroes venture into ruins or deep into the
darkest forests, things change — these forbidden places are alien and magical, cold
and terrifying. Things that were meant to be forgotten dwell there...
d NATURAL FANTASY MAGIC
Magic is strongly tied to nature, life, and the elements: its traditions are largely oral,
passed down from elder to apprentice, and a mystery to most people. The magic
found in the ruins, however, is cold and artificial, a remnant of an age of golems and
machinery that defied and angered the forces of nature.
d NATURAL FANTASY ANTAGONISTS
In a natural fantasy world, antagonists tend to be disastrous calamities or ancient
and powerful monsters. When the antagonist is a person, they are often misguided
or acting for what they believed to be good for their community: most of the time,
they will see reason after the heroes thwart their plans. The "true enemy", however, is
generally something that cannot be reasoned with, such as the immortal embodiment
of a natural disaster that will require great sacrifices to placate.

Heavy rain falls from polluted clouds, clanking sounds over the brass and steel pipework
spreading from one building to another. Casting its shadow over the rundown districts
is the massive shape of an industrial chimney, the factory below draining energy and
power from the depths of this Techno Fantasy world.
d TECHNO FANTASY THEMES AND PROTAGONISTS
Stories unfolding in a techno fantasy world are often darker and more serious in tone;
they revolve around the exploitation of natural resources, unchecked and ruthless
scientific experimentation, and abuse of power from the wealthy elite.
Their protagonists are often people fighting against injustice:
 The scarred hero who had everything taken from her by the elite.
 The last survivor from a line of magic users who sought harmony with the world.
 The former mercenary disgusted by his past actions.
 The failed experiment who was abandoned by their cold-hearted creator.
 The wealthy heir who realized her prosperity was built upon the ruin of others.
Together, they engage a desperate struggle against those few who rule the world and
the hearts of its people.

CHAPTER
d TECHNO FANTASY LOCATIONS
Techno fantasy locations often take the form of a literal "above and below", where the
shining palaces of the wealthy steal the very sun from the vast majority of the people
who struggle daily in the slums below. Outside the cities lies a barren world drained
of all life and beauty, turned grey by human greed.
d TECHNO FANTASY MAGIC
In a techno fantasy world, magic has largely been claimed by technology and turned
into yet another source of power, wealth, and warfare supremacy. The stream of
souls has been gravely wounded and corrupted, and the original ways of magic were
forgotten or — more likely — suppressed.
d TECHNO FANTASY ANTAGONISTS
The antagonists of a techno fantasy world should represent the darkness of modern
society and the ruthlessness of industry and exploitation. Wealthy and influential,
they simultaneously base their authority on brute military force and stolen magic or
artifacts. But perhaps their most insidious quality is that many people still see them
as ideal leaders and miraculously self-made saviors, and are willing to be exploited
and oppressed every day in the vain hope of gaining their favor. Left unchecked, their
egotistical ambitions will lead to magical cataclysms or full-scale war.
22
W
GAME MATERIALS
Among the best qualities of roleplaying games is that they generally do not require
particularly expensive materials beyond the rulebook — and you already have that in
your hands!
To play the game, you will need the following:
GAME SHEETS
These print-outs are used to keep track of important game information.
 Character sheets are used to track information about each Player Character. The first
sheet contains most of the data, while the second sheet will generally be needed
once your character grows in power — or if they learn to use magic.
 The group sheet is shared by all participants, and it is used to keep track of the
characters, creatures, and locations they have encountered. It also features a list of
the consumable items you will often use during your travels, such as potions and
antidotes.
 The world sheet is generally managed by the Game Master and used to record
important information concerning your game world — kingdoms, powerful characters,
historical events, and great mysteries yet unsolved.
 Finally, the map sheet features the map of your game world and is used to calculate
travel distances and mark the position of important features such as cities, temples,
fortresses, and ruins. You start the game with only one map sheet, but might end up
using more if you explore uncharted territories.
If you have purchased this book, you probably already have a .pdf version of each
sheet; in case you don't, you can find them at fabulaultima.com.
PAPER, PENCILS, AND ERASERS
Most of the time, you will want to write on your sheets in pencil — this will allow you
to easily correct mistakes and update any information you have recorded.
You will also need a few pieces of blank paper for quick sketching and notes.
1
INTRODUCTION
23
W
CHAPTER TOKENS
Some characters will have special "points" at their disposal: Player
Characters have Fabula Points and Villains have Ultima Points.
You will need tokens of two different colors to represent these
(green and red plastic gemstones work great).
The more tokens you have, the better.
DICE
The game makes use of a variety of dice in different shapes:
 Six-sided dice, also known as d6s — these you are surely familiar with.
 Eight-sided dice, also known as d8s.
 Ten-sided dice, also known as d10s — the "0" face should be read as 10.
 Twelve-sided dice, also known as d12s.
 Twenty-sided dice, also known as d20s.
These dice are sometimes mentioned in notations such as "roll 1d6 + 1d10", which
means you need to roll a six-sided die and a ten-sided die and add them together,
or "roll 1d8 + 1", which means rolling an eight-sided die and adding 1 to the Result.
When the game uses the term "die size", it means the number of faces on that die —
for instance, a d10 has a size of 10. Some effects will reduce or increase die size; for
instance, a reduced d8 will turn into a d6, while an increased d10 will become a d12.
The full succession of die sizes, from highest to lowest, is:
You can find these sets of polyhedral dice in game stores (or you can purchase them
online). You can also download mobile apps that roll dice for you!
24
W
THE PLAYERS
If you are a Player, here's how you should approach the game:
READ THIS BOOK
Make sure to read the Introduction — hey, you’re already doing that! — learn the
Game Rules and familiarize yourself with the World Creation, Group Creation, and
Character Creation processes in the Press Start chapter.
You might want to steer clear of the Bestiary chapter, since your Game Master will
likely pit you against some of the creatures contained within it — spoilers!
GATHER THE PROPER TOOLS
To play the game you will need pencils, erasers, a character sheet for your hero, a
shared group sheet, and your own set of polyhedral dice (d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20).
If you can, pick up a spare set of dice and share them with everyone else at the table.
CREATE THE GAME WORLD
Together with everyone else you will give birth to a fantastical setting, populated by
bizarre monsters, great mysteries, and powerful magic (see page 148).
While doing so, you must adhere to the Eight Pillars discussed on the previous pages
— but aside from that, you are free to come up with whatever regions, characters, and
legends you want!
CHOOSE AN ARCHETYPE FOR YOUR GROUP
Once you have created a game world for your story, you must choose the kind of
group your characters will form: will you be guardians of a miraculous artifact,
revolutionaries fighting against a corrupt empire, or perhaps heroes who have been
brought together by fate?
Talk with your Game Master and with the other Players and discuss the kind of story
you all want to tell — then, choose an appropriate group type!
For more information on group types, see page 152.

INTRODUCTION
25
W
CHAPTER CREATE YOUR HEROIC CHARACTER
Keeping the unique characteristics of your group and world in mind, create the Player
Character (PC) you will control during gameplay. Discuss each character’s role within
your group, as well as any Bonds and relationships!
COOPERATE WITH EVERYONE ELSE
When playing the game, pay attention to what everybody else is saying and remember
to leave room for everyone to shine: each hero should get their time in the spotlight. Do
your best to cooperate with the other Players and make sure your table environment
is enjoyable and welcoming. Be curious and enthusiastic, suggest goals for the group,
and support each other!
CONTRIBUTE TO THE ONGOING STORY
Bring your energy and ideas to the table, creating a story by cooperating with everyone
else. If you want your character’s emotions and flaws to be a living part of this shared
tale, act accordingly: in Fabula Ultima, all participants are equally responsible for the
quality of the game experience.
See your character as the tool with which you will shape part of the ongoing narrative.
PLAY AS A HERO
The protagonists of Fabula Ultima are heroes and adventurers, larger-than-life
characters with unique abilities and an epic — sometimes tragic — destiny. When
you play the game, keep this premise in mind: act heroically, don’t back down from
challenges, and try to make the world a better place. Sometimes, it will make sense for
your character to do something you wouldn't: this is part of the beauty of roleplaying
games — allow your character to lead you on this journey of discovery!
PLAY TO CHANGE AND EVOLVE
Your character should be far from an immutable entity: while their past may be complex
and tragic, the way they will change and grow during play is far more important.
Character evolution lies at the core of adventure: embrace it!
26
W
THE GAME MASTER
If you are the Game Master, here's how you should approach the game:
READ THIS BOOK
Make sure to read the Introduction — hey, you’re already doing that! — learn the Game
Rules and familiarize yourself with the World Creation, Group Creation, and Character
Creation processes in the Press Start chapter. You should also pay special attention to
the Game Master chapter and learn how to consult the Bestiary.
GATHER THE PROPER TOOLS
To play the game you will need pencils, erasers, a world sheet for your game world
and a variable amount of map sheets, depending on the size of your setting — you
will likely only need one at the beginning, and then print some more as the heroes
explore the world. You will also need one or more sets of polyhedral dice (d6, d8, d10,
d12, and d20).
FOLLOW THE RULES
Learn the rules of the game and apply them as they are written. If you think one or
more elements should be altered, discuss the matter with everyone else. Only change
those elements if the entire group has agreed on how to do so.
TAKE PART IN WORLD, GROUP AND CHARACTER CREATION
Assist the Players during World Creation (page 148), Group Creation (page 152), and
Character Creation (page 154). Use this time to ask lots of questions: what are the
core themes of each protagonist? What experiences tie them together? Do they have
a common enemy? Take note of everything — all of this will come back to help you
create engaging situations during gameplay.
BREATHE LIFE INTO THE GAME WORLD
Regardless of the game world you have created together, it falls upon your shoulders
to populate it with fantastic locations, dangerous monsters, and powerful antagonists.
Stay true to the Eight Pillars and make sure you build on each Player Character’s
personal themes and motivations. Whenever you think a Player Character might know
about a place or event, ask the corresponding Player for creative input.

INTRODUCTION

W
CHAPTER BREATHE LIFE INTO YOUR VILLAINS
Pay great attention when portraying the main antagonists of the game, and make
sure you stay true to their goals and motivations. Just as Fabula Ultima’s protagonists
are larger-than-life heroes, their adversaries are powerful and formidable individuals,
who often conceal terrible secrets. Do your best to always portray their looming threat
and keep the pressure high!
COOPERATE WITH EVERYONE ELSE
When playing the game, pay attention to what everybody else is saying and encourage
everyone to play an active role: each participant should get their time in the spotlight.
Do your best to cooperate with everyone else and make sure the play environment is
enjoyable and welcoming.
PLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS
Never force the Players’ hand, and make sure not to “push” them towards a specific
event: let their actions and objectives guide you instead. Resist the temptation to
create a predetermined plot — let the heroes’ choices and actions tell you what
aspects of the story the Players really care about.
If you're used to other RPGs in which the Game Master controls the evolution of the
story and prepares scenes ahead of time, let go of that when playing this game — here,
you must only weave situations around what the Players decide to do and add details
to the world as required by the circumstances. The game gives them plenty of tools
to influence and shape the story, up to and including the ability to alter plot elements
you had previously introduced. Embrace this creative flow!
ASK QUESTIONS, BUILD ON THE ANSWERS
Move the action forward by asking questions to everyone else. What will you do now?
Where can you find this information? How do you feel about what happened? Are you
willing to risk your life for this? What will you tell your mother?
Ask plenty of questions, then build on the Players’ answers.
LOOK FOR INSPIRATION
Stories, ideas, pictures, characters, music, and maps: make sure to take advantage of all
possible sources of inspiration.

CHAPTER
GAME RULES
This chapter contains the core rules required to play Fabula Ultima.
This is probably the most important chapter in the book and one that should be read
with great attention, regardless of if you are the Game Master or a Player.
Throughout this chapter the game’s mechanics are presented in the way that felt most
intuitive; however, sometimes you will have to jump between pages in order to get the
full picture of how things work. It won’t happen too often, promise!
USEFUL ADVICE AND CHANGING THE RULES
Along the way, you will find that a large part of this chapter contains advice on how
to make the most out of this game's rules and mechanics. You will also find that
sometimes the very same situation can be resolved through different methods —
there’s some overlap between rules.
This is by design. Given the broad scope of the game and the many possible scenarios,
the rules must be flexible — but this also means you will have to learn how and
when to use them. That is why plenty of advice has been included wherever possible:
because this book is meant to be understood in the easiest way possible so that the
goals and intentions behind each rule are clear.
As you grow more familiar with the rules, you will probably want to change or tweak
some of them, and that’s perfectly fine. Nothing in this book was written to be set in
stone, but to be a functional game, whose components interact with each other and
work together to bring an epic, heroic and fantastic tale to your gaming table. Because
of this, make sure to think carefully about the changes you make: they might influence
a greater number of elements than what you had anticipated. To make life easier, the
book includes a variety of optional rules that can be used to safely customize your
play experience.
Needless to say, whenever you want to change something, make sure to discuss it with
your game group: you shouldn’t change anything unless everyone agrees.

O O O
SCENES
In order to play the game, you must first understand the concept of scenes.
A scene is a segment of gameplay with a beginning and an end, focused around a
specific character, obstacle, or conflict.
Scenes are an easy way to split the game into manageable “time sections” and also
act as a “stage”: characters who are not part of the current scene may not perform any
kind of action to affect the story.
It is the Game Master’s responsibility to declare the beginning and end of each scene,
but the Players can ask the Game Master to set up specific scenes as well.
Generally, a scene flows like this:
W
The Game Master can end the scene at any point, often wrapping things up with
a short description of what happens. You should generally end a scene when:
w The situation has been resolved (for better or worse).
w Gameplay has moved to a different time or location.
3
W
The Game Master introduces the scene and describes the situation (a process
known as framing the scene), especially the following:
w Which characters are present on the scene (this is often self-evident).
w The time and location of the scene.
w Creatures, items or other elements that the characters may interact with.
The GM should keep things simple — one or two sentences are enough.
1
W
Player Characters interact with what is present on the scene, and their actions
and decisions push the story forward. The GM describes how the environment
and Non-Player Characters react, and adds details to the scene as needed.
Characters may also enter and/or leave the scene, provided the GM agrees.
Additionally, there will be times when the outcome of a character’s action needs
to be determined by rolling dice (see Checks, on page 38).

CHAPTER
Once you start playing, you will find that scenes tend to flow naturally, so you will
rarely have to check whether a scene has ended.
That said, some rules and effects rely heavily on the scene structure: many spells, for
instance, last "until the end of the scene". Pay attention to these!
CONFLICT SCENES
When the heroes’ goals clash with those of another faction, things can get heated
and the Game Master may declare the beginning of a conflict scene — be it a battle, a
breakneck chase, or a tense audience with a king. During a conflict, the camera “zooms
in” and the characters’ actions are tracked in greater detail.
You can find more about conflicts starting on page 58, but you should read the rules
for Checks first — they’re on page 38.
INTERLUDE SCENES
There will be moments in the game where the story moves at a slower pace — a trek
across the plains, the long descent down a cavern, a night of rest in town, or even a
month spent waiting for an ally to recover. Instead of a moment-by-moment scene, we
can describe these situations as a sequence of short frames that shows our heroes as
they perform a variety of activities.
During an interlude scene (or "interlude"), each Player describes the general task
their character performs, whether it's searching the village for someone or staying on
the lookout for dangers in a dungeon. However, if a Player wants to have a detailed
interaction with someone or something, you should switch back to a standard scene.
Interlude scenes are especially useful when characters want to pursue long-term
objectives, such as Projects (see page 134), or to describe journeys (page 106).
GAME MASTER SCENES
If the Game Master wants, they may play a scene in which no Player Character is
present, and in which the Players are simply spectators, separate from their characters.
These Game Master scenes can be used to foreshadow an event, introduce a future
threat or show a Villain in action: they work just like cut scenes in a video game, or
pre-title scenes in many movies and TV show episodes.
Game Master scenes are an excellent way to add depth to antagonists and provide a
sense of narrative tension.

SESSIONS AND CAMPAIGNS
Now that you know how scenes work, let’s talk about sessions and campaigns.
SESSIONS
When combined, multiple scenes form a session.
Simply put, a session starts when you sit down to play and ends once you decide to
stop playing, usually because you have run out of time or think it is appropriate to
“pause the story” — perhaps once you've reached a suitably dramatic cliffhanger!
A typical session of Fabula Ultima will last approximately four hours. The more people
in your group, the longer each session tends to be.
The contents of a game session generally end up being close to what you would see
in a single episode of a show: the protagonists explore a specific location or situation
and alter it in some way; this, in turn, influences a larger overarching narrative — that
of the campaign.
CAMPAIGNS
Just as multiple scenes form a session, multiple sessions form a campaign: this term
indicates your group’s overarching story, the heroic tale you are all contributing to.
There is no set duration for a campaign: some people play a game for a couple of
weeks, others commit to it for years. When you sit down to play Fabula Ultima for
the first time, discuss how long you want to play — this will help you plan a schedule.
That being said, Fabula Ultima is designed to shine over the course of approximately
twenty to fifty game sessions. If you want to speed
things up, there are rules for faster advancement
on page 230!

CHAPTER
IMPORTANT RULES
CREATURES, ALLIES, AND ENEMIES
The term creature includes both PCs and NPCs. The term ally indicates someone who
the character believes is on their side in the scene, while the term enemy indicates the
opposite. If an effect targets allies, you cannot use it on yourself.
ALWAYS ROUND DOWN
While playing, you will sometimes need to halve numbers or divide them by a certain
value. When this happens, always round down to a minimum of 0.
ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE
If you ever need to perform multiple operations on the same number, you must do
so in the following order: additions u subtractions u multiplications u divisions.
SPECIFIC BEATS GENERAL
If a specific element of the game contradicts a general rule, that specific element will
take precedence.
Example: Normally, a Player Character cannot equip two shields at the same time.
However, the Skill Dual Shieldbearer (page 197) allows you to do so!
TIMING ISSUES
Sometimes a rule or effect will cause multiple choices or effects to trigger, and it will
be important to know who gets to act first.
 If all the choices and/or effects are controlled by the same person, that person will
choose in which order to apply them.
 If the choices and/or effects are controlled by different Player Characters, the Players
controlling them agree on which order to apply them in. If they cannot find an
agreement, randomly determine who takes precedence.
 If some of the choices and/or effects are controlled by Player Characters and others
are controlled by Non-Player Characters, Player Characters always go first.

W
ANATOMY OF A CHARACTER
In Fabula Ultima, all information pertaining to your character is tracked on a character
sheet. In order to better understand the rest of this chapter, it is important that you
familiarize yourself with the terms described below.
TRAITS
Each character has a total of three different Traits:
 Identity. This is a short sentence that sums up your character's general concept —
something like "Sky Pirate" or "Queenless Knight". You will choose your Identity when
you create your character, and may change it later on if you feel like your character
has developed enough that it is no longer fitting.
 Theme. This is a strong ideal or sentiment that drives your character's actions, such
as Anger, Justice, or Ambition. This too is something you will choose during character
creation, and it can change as your character evolves during play.
 Origin. This is where the character comes from, their homeland.
While playing, you will be able to invoke your
character's Traits to improve your odds
when rolling dice.
2
GAME RULES
35

CHAPTER
BONDS
Heroes need connections to grow stronger — and Bonds represent exactly that.
A Bond can be tied to one to three emotions, each belonging to one of three different
pairings, as shown on the character sheet:
 Admiration or inferiority;
 Loyalty or mistrust;
 Affection or hatred.
For each emotion in a Bond, the strength of that Bond is increased by one (up to a
strength of 3 if you have an emotion in each pairing).
Example: If you have a Bond of inferiority and loyalty towards the Sapphire Princess,
the strength of that Bond is 2. If you later begin to also feel affection towards her, its
strength becomes 3.
Just like Traits, Bonds can be invoked to improve your die rolls, and they can also
boost your ability to help your companions.
A character may have up to six Bonds at the same time. More information on Bonds
can be found on page 56.
FABULA POINTS
A powerful currency in the game that will come and go is Fabula Points. They can be
earned by facing adversities, and spent to invoke Traits and Bonds, as well as fuel
a variety of special effects. Players can also spend Fabula Points to introduce new
elements into the story and shape the world around their characters!
CHARACTER LEVEL
Your character's level is an abstract indication of their power. Characters generally
begin their adventures at level 5 and can climb up to level 50.
On average, you should gain enough Experience Points to reach a new level at the
end of every other session. The details of this system can be found on page 226.
36
W
CLASSES AND SKILLS
Whenever your character gains a level, that level will be put in one of the fifteen
Classes available in this book: either to develop an already obtained Class or start a
new one. Each Class grants a variety of Skills and abilities, and you choose which ones
you want to invest in — even if you and another hero share some Class choices, your
characters will end up being very different in how they are built and played.
Some Class Skills can be taken multiple times, becoming stronger or more flexible
whenever you do so. When the same Skill is taken multiple times, its Skill Level —
abbreviated as 【SL】 — will also increase. For instance, if you take the Guardian's
Fortress Skill twice (see page 197), its【 SL】 will be equal to 2.
If you want to take a look at the various Classes and their Skills, you can find them
starting on page 176.
ATTRIBUTES
A character's Attributes are an abstract representation of their training and aptitudes
in four different fields:
 Dexterity (DEX) measures precision, coordination, finesse and reflexes. You will need
it to move cautiously, defend yourself from attacks, craft objects, and fight using light
weapons, bows, and firearms.
 Insight (INS) represents observation, understanding, and reasoning. It is important
when investigating situations, casting spells, and defending yourself from magic.
 Might (MIG) is a measure of strength and fortitude. Most heavy weapons rely on
Might, and your ability to withstand pain and fatigue is also tied to this Attribute in
the form of Hit Points (see below).
 Willpower (WLP) represents determination, charisma, and discipline. You use your
Willpower for diplomacy and persuasion, but it also directly influences your ability to
cast spells and use special Skills, in the form of Mind Points (see below).
Each Attribute is represented by a die size, ranging from a six-sided die (d6) up to a
powerful twelve-sided die (d12). Some effects will temporarily alter your Attribute die
sizes: this is known as the current Attribute die size, while your default size is called
the base Attribute die size.
2
GAME RULES
37
W
CHAPTER
HIT POINTS, MIND POINTS, AND INVENTORY POINTS
These pools of points represent three different "resources" available to a character.
 Hit Points (HP) represent a character's ability to withstand pain and fatigue.
 Mind Points (MP) represent a character's focus and concentration.
 Inventory Points (IP) are an abstract resource that characters can spend to create
consumable items "on the spot", such as potions and antidotes.
DEFENSE AND MAGIC DEFENSE
These two parameters are mostly used during conflicts:
 Defense represents a character's ability to avoid being hit. It may represent dodging
blows (typically for characters with high Dexterity) as well as absorbing and
deflecting them through a clever use of shield and armor.
 Magic Defense represents a character's ability to anticipate and resist offensive
spells and similar magical attacks. It is mostly based on Insight.
INITIATIVE MODIFIER
This number indicates the character's ability to act quickly in a conflict scene.
EQUIPMENT AND BACKPACK
A character can equip a variety of items: weapons, shields, armor, and even powerful
magical accessories. Everything that cannot be equipped — such as a second suit of
armor or a different shield — will be stored in your backpack.
Consumables and single-use items such as potions and elixirs, on the other hand, are
represented by your Inventory Points.
ZENIT
Zenit is the common currency used in the worlds of Fabula Ultima.
The hopes and fears of this land now rest on your shoulders.
Ready or not, this is your fate.
38
W
CHECKS
The word “Check” indicates a die roll based on a character’s core Attributes: Dexterity,
Insight, Might, and Willpower.
In general, characters must perform Checks:
 When required by the game rules. Striking a target, casting a spell, and using a
Class Skill often requires a Check to determine success or failure. Effects that do not
explicitly call for a Check always succeed automatically.
 When asked by the Game Master. The Game Master has the right to ask characters
to perform Checks when attempting risky actions, facing opposition, or reacting to
danger. For the game to run smoothly, the Game Master must learn when to ask for a
Check and when not to do so (see next page).
Note that only the Game Master can ask for a Check; Players may never do so.
A Check is presented as a formula indicating which dice you have to roll and add up
together. Checks always require you to roll exactly two dice.
Example: An 【INS + WLP】 Check performed by a character with d6 Insight and
d10 Willpower will result in that character rolling a d6 and a d10 and adding them
together, thus generating a total Result between 2 and 16.
Some Checks will also require you to add or subtract a certain
number from the total you rolled:
Example: A Character performing a【 MIG + MIG】 +5
Check will roll their Might die twice
and then add 5 to the Result.
2
GAME RULES
39
W
CHAPTER
For a Game Master, knowing when to call for a Check and
when not to do so is a Skill that develops over time through
trial and error.
The following guidelines can be of help:
 The Player Characters are heroes. Unless there’s a capable opposition or
immediate threat, a Player Character's actions should simply succeed. Finding
the tavern requires no roll — getting there without being noticed by the local
bandit gang, on the other hand, will take some effort.
 Context and circumstances. The same action might require a Check depending
on when and where it takes place. Swimming in a calm river doesn’t require
a Check, while doing the same during a flood is extremely dangerous and
would require a Check.
 Relevant background. If a character’s Traits or general background are
enough for them to succeed, the Game Master should simply allow it. For
instance, an aristocrat will have little to no trouble securing an invitation for
a court ball.
 Impossible actions. Some actions simply cannot succeed, but you have to be
open to the Players’ creativity! You can’t jump from Earth to the Moon, but you
can build a magical ship to get there. You just need to remember that nothing
comes for free, and build interesting situations around the Players’ ideas.
 Relevant failure. Failing a Check means the situation gets worse. If failure
has no relevant impact on the situation, the Game Master should simply
describe the outcome of the action and skip the Check. The same is true when
a character isn’t acting under pressure: their actions may require time, but
they will no doubt achieve their goal.
 Stick to the rules. If the rules ask for a Check — or if they don’t — there’s
probably a good reason. Think twice before doing the opposite, and only do
so if everyone at the table is okay with it.
WHEN TO PERFORM CHECKS
40
W
CHECK TERMINOLOGY
The following terms are key to understanding how Checks work:
 Modifier. Any numerical value that is added to or subtracted from a Check. If you
perform a【 DEX + MIG】 +2 Check, for instance, the modifier is “+2”.
If the modifier is added, it is a bonus; if it is subtracted, it is a penalty.
 Result. The final number generated by the Check, after applying any modifiers.
 Difficulty Level. Abbreviated as DL. If the Result of the Check is greater than or equal
to this number, then the action is successful.
The Difficulty Level for a Check will either be set by the rules or chosen by the GM.
 High Roll. Abbreviated as HR. It indicates the higher of the two dice rolled in a Check
and will be used to calculate various effects (typically weapon and spell damage).
For instance, if you roll d8 + d10 for a Check and the dice show a 6 and a 9, the HR
for the Check will be 9.
CRITICAL SUCCESS
When both dice rolled during a Check show the same number, and that number is 6 or
higher, the Result is a critical success.
Another way to put this is that you will score a critical success on a double 6, double
7, double 8, double 9, double 10, double 11, or double 12.
If you roll a critical success, your Check is automatically successful and you get to
apply the effects of an opportunity (see next page).
FUMBLE
When both dice rolled during a Check show a 1, the Result is a fumble, which is
the exact opposite of a critical success: no matter the modifiers, a fumbled Check
is always a failure — not due to the character’s incompetence, but because of some
unfortunate twist. When you roll a fumble, whoever controls your opposition in this
scene gets an opportunity (see next page).
When a Player Character rolls a fumble, they immediately earn 1 Fabula Point (see
page 96).

CHAPTER
OPPORTUNITIES
Opportunities are unexpected twists in the story — sometimes good, sometimes bad.
When you spend an opportunity, you may pick an option from the list below or come
up with a different twist that fits the current scene. The Game Master has final say on
whether an opportunity is appropriate to the current situation, and some spells and
Skills will allow you to spend opportunities in new and powerful ways.
Example: Valea the thief is hopping from roof to roof in an attempt to shake off Count
Eligor’s mercenaries. The Game Master calls for a【 DEX + MIG】 Check and Valea rolls
a 7 and a 7, a critical success!
The Player controlling Valea describes how she loses her pursuers and chooses the
Favor opportunity: her daring performance will earn her the sympathy of the villagers,
who were already fed up with the Count’s tyranny!
OPPORTUNITIES
Advantage The next Check performed by you or an ally will receive a +4 bonus.
Affliction A creature suffers dazed, shaken, slow or weak (see page 94).
Bonding You create a Bond towards someone or something or add an emotion
to one of your existing Bonds (see page 56).
Faux Pas Choose a creature present on the scene: they make a compromising
statement chosen by the person who controls them.
Favor Your actions earn you someone’s support or admiration.
Information You spot a useful clue or detail. The Game Master may tell you what it
is, or ask you to introduce that detail yourself.
Lost Item An item is destroyed, lost, stolen, or left behind.
Progress You may fill or erase up to two sections on a Clock (see page 52).
Plot Twist! Someone or something of your choice suddenly appears on the scene.
Scan You discover one Vulnerability (see page 92) or one Trait (see page
302) of a creature you can see.
Unmask You learn the goals and motivations of a creature of your choice.

PERFORMING AN ATTRIBUTE CHECK
In its most basic form, a Check is known as an Attribute Check and works as follows:
O O O
W
The character rolls the appropriate dice, adding them together and applying any
relevant modifiers coming from Skills, spells, equipment, or other effects.
4
W The character performing the Check states which goal they want to accomplish;
the Game Master may also want to further clarify what can be achieved by
succeeding at the Check.
Sometimes, the goal will be the successful application of a Skill.
1
W
The Game Master declares the Difficulty Level (DL) for the Check, using the
table on the next page as a reference.
Sometimes, the Difficulty Level will be indicated by a specific rule.
The Game Master must also inform the Player about what the consequences of
a failure will be, making sure everyone understands what is at stake.
3
OW The Player controlling the character describes their approach to the situation,
which is to say, how they intend to pursue their goal.
Based on that approach, the Game Master chooses which Attributes must be
rolled, such as【 DEX + MIG】 o【r WLP + WLP】.
Sometimes, the appropriate Attributes will be indicated by a specific rule.
2
OW
If the character rolled a fumble or a critical success, apply the corresponding
effects (including the automatic failure or success). Otherwise...
5
OW
... if the Result of the Check is greater than or equal to the Difficulty Level, the
character succeeds. If it is lower, the character fails.
6
OW
Finally, the outcome of the Check changes the current situation: either the
character achieved their goal, or things took a turn for the worse.

CHAPTER
DIFFICULTY LEVELS
A Check’s Difficulty Level (DL) is a measure of how complex and risky a certain
operation can be. It abstracts several elements into a single number:
 The amount of knowledge and expertise required to complete the operation.
 Any helpful or hindering circumstances such as harsh weather conditions, poor
visibility, exhaustion, or supernatural influences.
 The lack or presence of important resources (time, space, materials, etc.) that are
needed to achieve the character’s goal.
 The kind of impact the action will have on the story, be it now or later.
In summary, Difficulty is an abstraction of how the current situation is opposing or
hindering the character. The true question you should ask yourself when determining
the Difficulty Level for a check, as indicated by the table below, is “Who is likely to
accomplish this?”
DETERMINING THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL FOR A CHECK
DL Action Difficulty Who is likely to accomplish this?
7 Easy Anyone with a bit of training or natural talent.
10 Normal A competent person, or a very talented one.
13 Hard An expert or a prodigy.
16 Very Hard Someone who is among the very best in that field.
GO WITH TEN
If you are the Game Master and find yourself stumped when choosing an appropriate
Difficulty Level for a Check, use 10: it is neither too low nor too high, and it's easy to
remember.
44
W
CHECKS IN PLAY
Now that you know the mechanical process behind a Check, let's take a look at how
it will work in play.
Our heroes have been allowed before the High Master of Relde, a village whose aid
would prove invaluable in the struggle against Empress Almara's forces.
Since Relde's people are well-versed in philosophy and magic, everyone agrees this
negotiation should be handled by Brigid, the group's scholar.
Brigid's Player, Emil, describes her goal and approach: "Brigid doesn't like to beat
around the bush, so... I'll simply stand before the High Master and explain that Almara's
army is getting closer by the day. If the people of Relde forbid them from crossing the
mountain pass, the army will be forced to take a longer route and we'll have more time
to prepare for the battle and evacuate the locals."
The Game Master nods. "Okay. Is there anything else you think you can use to your
advantage? This won't be easy, you're asking him to endanger his own people."
"I... not really. But I'll add this: if he refuses, we still plan on fighting the Empire,
tooth and nail. Which means his village and the pass will probably become a base of
operations for the Imperial forces, sooner or later."
"I see. I was thinking Insight + Willpower for the Check, but you are almost threatening
him... so Willpower + Willpower seems better."
"Oh, I'm great at Willpower! So... thanks, I guess?"
"Yours is a bit of a risky play. If the Check fails, you'll probably be kicked out of Relde.
Still, Reldeans are keepers to many secrets and wouldn't want them to fall into
Imperial hands... because of that, the Difficulty Level is just 10."
Brigid has a Willpower of d10, so she rolls 2d10 and adds them together... only a 5!
It is normally the Game Master’s role to describe the outcome of an action by taking
into account the character’s stated goals and the Result of their Check; however, taking
a step back and asking for input can make for great roleplay moments.
"That doesn't look good," the Game Master raises their eyebrows. "How about you tell
me where you messed up?"
"You know what? I think the problem is there's some bad blood between Relde's
"faculty" and my own. The High Master probably doesn't like that I'm implying his
people wouldn't stand a chance against the empire..."
"Oh, I like that a lot! But he doesn't. You're quickly escorted outside the village."
2
GAME RULES
45
W
CHAPTER
SUCCESS AND FAILURE
Keep the following in mind when you describe the impact of a Check:
 Never subvert the outcome. No matter the premise, the outcome of the Check must
be applied for what it is. No one at the table can turn a failure into a success and vice
versa: otherwise, why would dice be rolled in the first place?
That said, Player Characters may influence Checks in several ways, such as invoking
Traits and Bonds (see next two pages) and succeeding at a cost (explained below).
 Relevant success. If a character succeeds at a Check, they have confronted the
odds and emerged victorious. The Game Master shouldn’t call for further Checks to
“confirm” their success: they have earned it.
If you think an objective requires multiple Checks, use a Clock (see page 52).
 No do-overs. Just like a success should not require further confirmation, a failure
means you can't "try again" unless the situation is drastically altered in some way.
This rule allows Player Characters to turn failure into
success, but it comes at a steep price. When a character fails
a Check, anyone may propose a success at a cost. The Game
Master can make adjustments to the cost as they see fit, and
then the Player who performed the Check can accept or refuse.
When determining whether a given cost would be appropriate, remember that it
should put the character in a rough spot or take something important away from
them. If a cost can be remedied with little effort, something is wrong.
Back to the previous example: The High Master might listen to Brigid's
reasons, but only if she publicly apologizes and admits that Relde's
scholars are better than her.
You cannot succeed at a cost if your character fumbled the Check.
When you succeed at a cost, the Check's High Roll and Result remain the same.
OPTIONAL: SUCCESS AT A COST
46
W
INVOKING A TRAIT TO REROLL DICE
Player Characters can attempt to turn the tide in their favor by calling upon one of
their core Traits: their Identity, Origin, and Theme.
For instance, a character might have Shadow Knight as their Identity, Gaonia Empire
as their Origin, and Guilt as their Theme.
After performing a Check, a Player Character may spend 1 Fabula Point and invoke one
of their Traits to immediately pick up one or both dice and roll them again, replacing
the old roll with the new one. They may do so any number of times as part of the same
invocation, but each new reroll (of one or both dice) will cost another Fabula Point.
You cannot invoke a Trait if your character fumbled the Check.
Example: Ricard the mage is rushing towards the docking platform of Sorcerer
Antigles’ airship. His companions, Edgar and Valea, are held captive within the vessel.
There are only a few seconds left before the airship lifts off; Nadia (the Game Master)
asks Ricard’s Player, Mark, to perform a【 DEX + MIG】 Check with a Difficulty Level of
13: given that Ricard only has a d6 in both Attributes, the situation is pretty desperate.
Mark rolls the dice and gets a 6 and a 3, definitely not enough for him to succeed.
However, Ricard has 2 Fabula Points left. “Ricard’s Identity is that of a Young Traveling
Mage, which isn’t that useful here...” Mark frowns, “And his Origin is Malorn Village...
which doesn’t help either. But... I could still use my Theme!”
“Tell me more!” Nadia inquires.
“Well, Ricard’s Theme is Belonging. He is terribly afraid of losing the companions he
has found, of being on his own again. I think this will push him beyond his limits!”
“Okay! Makes sense. I imagine you're only going to reroll that 3, right?”
“Yeah, I'm hoping for a critical success here... oh wow! I just rolled another 6!!!"
"Which means you succeed automatically...! Care to describe the scene for us?"
Mark grins. "Sure! Oh, and by the way, here's the Fabula Point. So, the guards patrolling
the area see a thin boy wearing a pointy hat plunge himself from the platform; but
once the airship lifts off, there’s someone clinging desperately to the landing gear!...
Uhm, I mean, airships do have a landing gear, right?”
Players should describe their actions in a way that is coherent with their Identity,
Origin, or Theme if they want to spend a Fabula Point. Basically, you shouldn’t do this
when it feels forced within the narration — but then again, you as a Player have final
say on how and when you spend your Fabula Points.
2
GAME RULES
47
W
CHAPTER
INVOKING A BOND TO IMPROVE YOUR CHECK
Just like how a character's Traits can be used to reroll dice, Bonds — which is to say, the
feelings they harbor towards others — allows them to increase the Result of Checks.
After performing a Check, a Player Character may spend 1 Fabula Point and invoke one
of their Bonds to add the strength of that Bond to the Result. For more information
about Bonds and their strength, see page 56.
This can only be done once per Check.
Back to the previous example: Let's say Ricard invokes his Theme to reroll, but the
dice come up a 6 and a 5; unfortunately, this isn't enough.
Mark has 1 Fabula Point left: he could spend it to reroll the 5 and hope for a critical
success, but there's a safer alternative: he decides to invoke his Bond with Sorcerer
Antigles himself. This is a Bond of inferiority (because Antigles is a stronger mage)
and hatred (because he devastated Ricard's village when he stole the Dragonstone).
"I think I simply cannot allow him to take anyone else away from me. It won't be like
the last time... I will be there and I will stop him, no matter the cost."
Nadia nods. "That's a strength 2 Bond, which means you get to 13 and succeed!"
A Bond should only be invoked when it makes sense — just like Traits, you shouldn't
invoke them if it feels forced.
"Scared, Princess? I'm glad. Only when properly scared
can we show some good measure of courage!"
If you use this optional rule, Players may invoke their
character's Bonds and Traits to intentionally fail Checks
and earn Fabula Points.
Once per scene before making a Check, a Player may describe
how the character's Bonds or Traits prevent them from achieving
success - this is done instead of performing the Check itself.
The Check is then treated as an automatic failure with a Result and High Roll
equal to 0. Then, the character gains 1 Fabula Point.
You cannot invoke to fail on Support Checks (page 50), and you cannot succeed
at a cost (page 45) on a Check you already invoked to fail.
OPTIONAL: INVOKING TO FAIL
48
W
ACCURACY CHECKS
This type of Check works like a normal Attribute Check, but it is performed when a
character wants to strike targets that are ready to defend themselves. Each weapon
lists a specific Accuracy formula; a Steel Dagger, for instance, requires a roll o【f DEX
+ INS】 +1. The Difficulty Level is generally equal to the target’s Defense score.
When performing an Accuracy Check, the High Roll (HR) will be used to determine
how much damage you deal.
You can find more about attacks on page 68 and weapons on page 128.
MAGIC CHECKS
This type of Check works just like a normal Attribute Check too, but it is used when
a character wants to cast an offensive spell or perform a Ritual. The Attributes will
depend on the kind of magic used by the character.
When performing a Magic Check, the High Roll (HR) will sometimes be used to
determine the effectiveness of the spell cast.
You can find more about magic starting on page 112.
OPPOSED CHECKS
This special kind of Attribute Check is the fastest way to determine the outcome of a
competition between characters, such as a race, a chase or a debate.
Each character taking part in the Opposed Check performs the same Attribute Check,
with no Difficulty Level: whoever gets the highest Result is the winner. In the case of
a draw, the characters that rolled the same Result simply repeat the Check until one
of them emerges victorious.
During Opposed Checks, fumbles are the lowest possible Result and critical successes
are the highest possible Result. They generate opportunities as normal; if two or more
characters roll a fumble or a critical success, these count as a draw and the Checks
should be repeated.
Example: Montblanc the knight is struggling to free himself from the formidable
grasp of a dragon. The GM declares this is an Opposed Check using【 DEX + MIG】.
Montblanc rolls d8 + d10, but the dragon boasts a powerful d12 + d12: when the dice
hit the table: Montblanc gets 8 and 8, while the dragon rolls 9 and 12.
Despite the dragon rolling a total of 21, Montblanc’s 16 is a critical success: against
all odds, the brave knight manages to escape the monster’s deadly claws!

CHAPTER
OPEN CHECKS
This particular kind of Attribute Check has no Difficulty Level: instead, the Result tells
us how well the character performed. These Checks are often used when researching
information, examining an area or recalling important lore.
When you perform an Open Check, simply compare the Result with the table below:
rolling a 13 while studying an ancient painting means you manage to get information
worthy of an expert archaeologist, while rolling an 8 would only net you basic hints of
what the artist wanted to portray.
Result Equates to...
7+ What could be accomplished by a person with a bit of training or talent.
10+ What could be achieved by someone competent or very talented.
13+ The work of an expert or true prodigy.
16+ A result worthy of being remembered in history.
SITUATIONAL MODIFIERS
If a character performs a Check while in a strongly advantageous or disadvantageous
position, the Game Master may impose a +2 bonus or -2 penalty to the Result.
Example: Princess Camilla is attempting to persuade the Bandit Queen Remora to
stop raiding the nearby village of Karsa; however, Remora's lieutenant Toris is arguing
against her. This is an Opposed Check, but Camilla also offers Remora a single favor
on behalf of her family.
Because of this, the Game Master grants Camilla a +2 bonus to her Check.
Most of the time you will not need to use situational modifiers — adjusting the
Difficulty Level will be more than enough. However, they can prove useful when
said Difficulty is established by the rules (such as with an Accuracy Check) or during
Opposed Checks (as shown by the example above).
If you are the Game Master, use situational modifiers to reward approaches that take
advantage of the opposition's Traits, personality and objectives.

W
GROUP CHECKS
Characters can choose to cooperate in order to increase their chance of success within
specific situations.
Group Checks are performed as follows:
OW The characters nominate a leader: this is the character who will perform
the final Check and determine the action’s outcome. Everyone else acts as a
supporting character.
1
OW
Each supporting character performs a Support Check identical to the one the
leader will perform, but with a fixed Difficulty Level of 10.
Fumbles and critical successes rolled during Support Checks generate no
opportunities, but still count as automatic failures and successes.
2
OW
Each supporting character that successfully performed their Check will grant a
+1 bonus to the leader's Check.
3
OW
The leader performs the final Check, which works as normal and may generate
opportunities in case of a fumble or critical success.
The Check's outcome affects everyone who took part in the Group Check.
5
OW
If any of the successful supporting characters have a Bond towards the leader,
the highest strength among those Bonds is also added to the leader's Check.
Remember, only add the single highest Bond strength.
4
Group Checks are extremely useful when two or more characters are performing the
same operation together; the Game Master always has final say on whether a Group
Check is possible or should be performed.
Example: Three heroes are trying to persuade the Great Owl to grant them access
to her ancient library. The leader performs a DL 13【 INS + WLP】 Check, and the two
supporting characters perform【 INS + WLP】 Checks with a Difficulty of 10. They both
succeed, and one has a strength 2 Bond towards the leader. Thus, the leader's Check
will receive a total bonus equal to +4.

FREQUENTLY USED CHECKS
The table below contains a list of circumstances that might require a Check and the
typical Attributes that would be involved.
Situation Suggested Check
Moving silently, hiding and acting unnoticed. 【DEX + DEX】
Avoiding a trap or finding a way to flee a collapsing building. 【DEX + INS】
Anticipating someone’s movements and catching them by surprise. 【DEX + INS】
Completing a work of craftsmanship or repairing something. 【DEX + INS】
Moving gracefully to earn someone’s attention. 【DEX + WLP】
Examining or investigating someone or something. 【INS + INS】
Remembering useful information about something. 【INS + INS】
Getting information from someone during a conversation. 【INS + WLP】
Persuading someone through authority or diplomacy. 【INS + WLP】
Hard work, such as lifting a portcullis or pushing a statue. 【MIG + MIG】
Resisting intense pain or fatigue. 【MIG + WLP】
Intimidating someone with your strength. 【MIG + WLP】
Beneath the Crystal Temple slumbers the Great
Dragon God, who once turned the Babel Empire to ash.
If you use this optional rule, Players can decide one of the
Attributes involved in each Check they perform, while the
Game Master decides the other (which can be the same
Attribute or a different one).
This rule does not apply to Checks whose Attributes are already
established by the rules, such as Accuracy Checks.

CLOCKS
Also called timers, counters, trackers, or countdowns: Clocks are a useful tool for
tracking an evolving situation, an approaching danger, or the characters' progress with
a certain task.
Clocks are designed to handle complex activities that cannot be resolved with a single
Check and are a great tool for Game Masters to manage pacing within a scene.
A Clock is a circle split into a number of sections, each of them representing a step
towards an objective being completed or an event taking place:
 When the group infiltrates a guarded area and must not alert the surveillance, failed
Checks might fill a “High Alert!” Clock.
 When the heroes realize they can’t defeat a colossal foe in usual combat, they might
choose to adopt a different tactic: striking the stone columns and causing the roof
to collapse on top of the enemy! In this scenario, a Clock can be used to keep track
of how weakened the ceiling’s support is; once filled, the monster will be crushed
under the debris!
 When a powerful sorcerer performs a world-altering ritual, a Clock named “arcane
apocalypse” can be used to represent how much time is left to stop him!
A Clock normally features four to twelve sections, depending on its complexity.
Clocks are generally created and managed by the Game Master, but should be visible
to everyone: this makes for tense and adrenaline inducing play. They should also be
tied to a specific obstacle, goal, or danger, but not to a specific method or approach:
this will allow characters to interact with them in different ways. Let’s take the
collapsing ceiling described above: characters could accomplish that by striking the
pillars, pulverizing them with magic, or even throwing an enemy against them!

GAME RULES

CHAPTER
ADVANCING A CLOCK
In general, Clocks advance through Checks:
 Fill one section for a successful Check.
 Fill an additional section if the Result of the Check surpassed the Difficulty Level (or
the opponent's Result in case of an Opposed Check) by 3 or more, or two additional
sections if it was by 6 or more.
 If the Check was a critical success, the corresponding opportunity may be spent to
fill two additional sections.
Vice versa, Clocks that represent a threat gradually fill as characters fail Checks,
especially if they fail them by a wide margin:
 Fill one section for a failed Check.
 Fill an additional section if the Result of the Check is lower than the Difficulty Level
(or the opponent's Result in case of an Opposed Check) by 3 or more, or two additional
sections if it was by 6 or more.
 If the Check was a fumble, the corresponding opportunity may be spent to fill two
additional sections.
Example: While sneaking her way through the monster-infested corridors of an
ancient castle, Valea rolls a 6 on a Check with Difficulty Level 10. The Game Master
fills two sections on the "Ambushed!" Clock — one for her failure, and another because
she failed the Check by three or more.
Clocks should always interact with what happens in the
story. The Game Master should use situational modifiers
and adjust the Difficulty Level to represent advantages
or disadvantages derived from the Players' choices and the
events that are taking place in the scene.
CLOCKS AND THE STORY
54
W
A THRESHOLD FOR FAILURE
If you use a Clock to represent a complex series of operations to achieve a goal, you
must also establish when that goal will be irredeemably lost: does it take a single
failed Check, or is there a parallel "failure" Clock that fills whenever a character rolls
poorly? The Game Master determines this on a case-by-case basis, but must make sure
to inform the Players as they approach the challenge.
TURNING BACK A CLOCK
Characters can also take action to slow a Clock's advance and erase some of the filled
sections, eventually bringing it back to 0 — the method is identical to that of filling
a Clock. When a Clock reaches 0, the Game Master may have the threat removed or
simply keep it lurking in the shadows.
Example: As the heroes fight the powerful sorceress Chrona, her ritual to open a rift
to the Demon Realm draws to its conclusion. The Player Characters must balance their
actions between defeating the sorceress and slowing down the progress of the ritual,
a ten-section Clock that would end the scene in an automatic defeat.
2
GAME RULES
55
W
CHAPTER
OTHER EVENTS
If the Game Master feels like a certain event should fill or erase sections of a Clock
(even if that event is not tied to a Check), they are free to fill or erase one section, or
two sections for a major event.
On the other end of that, some of the characters' choices might automatically fill a
Clock or make it completely useless — for instance, smashing the Crystal of Life to
pieces will make the "channel the power of the Crystal" Clock irrelevant.
The Game Master is responsible for discarding Clocks that no longer matter within the
story, provided this doesn't strip the Player Characters of the ability to shape the story.
CLOCKS DURING CONFLICT SCENES
The section beginning on page 58 details the rules for conflict scenes — chases,
battles, audiences, and more! These scenes will see characters working against each
other to achieve goals, and Clocks are an excellent way to keep track of everyone's
progress, as explained under the Objective action (page 72).
Example: During a duel between the two rivals Bertrand and Duma, the Game Master
assigns each participant a six-section Clock. The first challenger to complete their
Clock will win the duel.
USING CLOCKS FOR PACING AND PRESSURE
The Game Master should also employ Clocks to signal that the heroes have a
limited amount of time to stop an antagonist's plans, obtain a specific item, or learn
information. In short, Clocks should be used to convey pressure and keep the tension
high — seeing how much time is left, the heroes will be able to manage their resources
appropriately and should feel like every action is impactful.
Example: The Obliterator Airship Babel will be operative within four days. If they want
to neutralize its soul core and prevent the Emperor from conquering the region, the
heroes have no time to lose!
The Game Master draws a huge Clock on the world map — four sections only!
Clocks like these are "time trackers" and normally can't be directly influenced through
Checks — they should be the focus of one or more sessions.

W
Bonds are a source of power for our heroes. You already know that Bonds can help
improve Checks (page 47) or aid allies during Group Checks (page 50), but some Class
Skills and even equipment effects will also benefit from Bonds.
EMOTIONS AND STRENGTH
Each Bond may feature up to three emotions from the following six:
 Admiration. You believe you have much to learn from this person and deeply respect
them for their efforts and achievements.
 Inferiority. You envy this person or feel like you would be powerless against them.
Their very presence frustrates you, acting as a reminder of your failures.
 Loyalty. This person has won your trust, or you believe in their ideals. You are ready
to endanger yourself to help or protect them.
 Mistrust. You don't believe the words of this person and doubt their intentions.
 Affection. You have tender feelings for this person, be they a love interest, a dear
friend, or a member of your family.
 Hatred. You can scarcely control yourself in the presence of this person, and would do
anything to see them broken and defeated.
The six emotions are combined into three pairings, and the same Bond may only be
connected to one emotion from each pairing.
 Admiration or inferiority;
 Loyalty or mistrust;
 Affection or hatred.
For each emotion in a Bond, the strength of that Bond is increased by one (up to a
strength of 3 if you have an emotion in each pairing).
If you have the Dark Knight Belphegor among your Bonds and you feel inferiority and
hatred towards him, that Bond has a strength of 2.
BONDS

GAME RULES
57
W
CHAPTER
CREATING A BOND
Bonds are generally created during resting scenes (page 91), through opportunities
or due to specific Skills. Whenever an effect in the game allows you to "create a Bond",
you may add a new Bond to your character sheet and immediately tie a single emotion
to it. This means that all Bonds start with a strength of 1.
You can have Bonds towards characters, nations, kingdoms, organizations, and even
religions. You cannot have a Bond towards yourself.
STRENGTHENING A BOND OR CHANGING EMOTIONS
You can make your Bonds grow stronger by adding more emotions to them (up to a
maximum of three emotions, one per pairing). This is generally done during resting
scenes (see page 91), which will also allow you to shift emotions around and adjust
them to the more recent developments in your story.
ERASING A BOND
If you already have six Bonds and want to create a new one, you must first erase one of
your existing Bonds. Explain how your feelings and perspective changed.
BONDS ARE STRONGER THAN DEATH
Even if a character dies or leaves your story, any Bonds other characters had with them
will remain until erased.
Bonds make your character stronger while reminding you of
their ties with the rest of the world and its people.
Do not shy away from complex Bonds: feeling both affection
and inferiority towards someone, or hatred and admiration,
can and will make your story more memorable.
The best choice is often to let Bonds grow organically, while also reaping the
benefits that come from having many high-strength Bonds.
THE ROLE OF BONDS
58
W
CONFLICT SCENES
When the story gets to a climax, when the stakes are high and when every split second
can make a difference, a conflict scene begins.
A conflict is a series of back-and-forth exchanges at a rapid pace. You have no doubt
encountered something like this in movies and TV series: time slows down and the
camera zooms in on every single action.
All of the following might make for good conflicts:
 A chase scene amidst the narrow city alleys.
 An infiltration scene where some of the characters sneak past enemy surveillance,
perhaps while allies provide a useful distraction or cover operation.
 A skirmish between armed groups or a fight against a dangerous monster.
 A large-scale battle involving clashing armies from enemy kingdoms.
 A tense audience with a powerful figure.
 A duel between two ancient rivals.
USING CONFLICTS
As with any other scene, the Game Master is responsible for declaring the beginning
and end of conflicts. The ability to properly time conflicts is something that can only
be developed by playing the game. Draw inspiration from how videogames, movies,
and comics handle pacing — consuming a variety of different media can really help
keep things fresh!
Something you should never forget is that you are not bound to use conflict rules
for every battle, chase or debate — instead, you should save them for truly dramatic
situations. Checks and Clocks will often be more than enough to resolve a scene,
without the added complexity of conflict rules.
In general, aim for about one conflict scene every two hours of play.

The conflict is handled as a series of consecutive rounds: during each round, the
Player Characters' side and the enemy side alternate taking turns, starting with
one participant from the side who has the initiative.

 If one side outnumbers the other, keep alternating turns as long as possible,
then let the side with the numerical advantage take the remaining turns

DETERMINE PARTICIPANTS
First, discuss which characters present on the scene will take on an active role during
the conflict, and which ones will fade into the background. Player Characters are all
generally expected to take part in the conflict, as are any important antagonists — but
there might be times in which some prefer to stay away from the spotlight.
Example: The scholar Calliope has offered to help a young bandit by the name of
Randolph — she will act as his defendant in the upcoming trial.
The Game Master decides to run the trial as a conflict scene: the participants will be
Calliope and Randolph as well as the prosecutor, a man known as Orbek.
Interestingly enough, only one other Player decides to have their character take an
active role: Montblanc the knight will lend his reputation to help Randolph, while
the thief Valea will avoid being seen on the scene — her presence could undermine
Calliope's credibility, and she already did her part acquiring important evidence.
Everyone else — the bystanders, the guards, and even the judge herself — will not be
active participants. While the Game Master still describes their reactions and behavior,
those characters will not get to pursue their objectives or influence the conflict.
New participants may also enter a conflict while it is already underway: characters
who wish to do so can join the scene at the end of a round (after step 5).
DISCUSS GOALS
Each character involved in the conflict will have their reasons: perhaps you want
to steal a precious artifact, persuade the Queen of your good intentions, or avoid
becoming a monster's mid-afternoon snack. Your antagonists will have goals of
their own too, ranging from escaping unharmed to putting an end to your ceaseless
meddling.
During this step, each participant should make clear what their general goal in the
conflict will be, at least initially.
The Game Master is free to keep some of the antagonists' goals a secret — suffice it to
say, if a conflict takes place it's because at the very least they don't want the heroes to
achieve their own objectives!
2
GAME RULES
61
W
CHAPTER
INITIATIVE
A character's Initiative modifier indicates how likely they are to give their side an edge
when a conflict begins.
 At the start of each conflict, the Player Characters perform an Initiative Group Check:
this is a Group Check (see page 50) that relies on Dexterity and Insight.
 The Difficulty Level for the leader's Check is equal to the highest Initiative Score
among the heroes' adversaries; supporting characters perform their Support Check
against the standard Difficulty Level of 10.
 Whether you act as the leader or as a supporting character in this Group Check,
remember to apply your Initiative modifier to your Result.
If the leader succeeds, this means the heroes seized initiative for this conflict and the
first participant to act during each round will be someone from the Player Characters'
side; if they fail, it means they have lost the initiative for this conflict and the first
participant to act during each round will be one of their foes.
See the next page for an explanation of rounds and turns.
Example: The warrior monk Silida and the mage Ricard are exploring the ruins of an
old waterway when they come across a bronze golem (page 330) barring their way!
The Game Master calls for an Initiative Group Check, and Ricard is happy to have Silida
be the leader. She only rolls a 6, but Ricard's Check is a 12 (even taking into account
the -2 penalty caused by the armor he is wearing). Silida's total is now 7, which is
enough to reach the golem's initiative score!
The Player Characters have seized the initiative, which means the first turn of each
round will belong to either Silida or Ricard.
Note that even if a new participant joins an ongoing conflict scene, they will simply
adapt to the existing initiative.
62
W
ROUNDS AND TURNS
Conflict scenes take place as a series of consecutive rounds.
During each round, the participants will alternate taking turns, starting with one
participant from the side who has the initiative.
Back to the previous example: Since the Player Characters seized the initiative, one
of them (Ricard or Silida) will be the first to take their turn during each round. Then,
the golem will take its turn; after the golem, the remaining Player Character will
finally be able to act. Then, a new round will begin.
Each turn allows for a single action — that said, some powerful effects might grant
characters the ability to perform multiple actions during the same turn.
You can find more about actions starting on page 66.
 A character cannot choose to "pass" if they have the opportunity to take a turn. If an
enemy just acted and you are the only Player Character who hasn't taken their turn
this round, for instance, you must take your turn.
 Sometimes one side will be outnumbered by their adversaries. If this happens, keep
alternating turns as long as possible, then let the side with the numerical advantage
take their remaining turns towards the end of the round.
Example: In a conflict with two PCs and three NPCs where the heroes have seized the
initiative, each round will be as follows:
PC Turn Z NPC Turn Z PC Turn Z NPC Turn Z NPC Turn
The round ends once every participant has performed the turn (or turns, in the case of
some exceptionally powerful creatures) at their disposal.
 There is no fixed duration for rounds and turns: they represent cinematic camera
movements and dramatic spotlight, not specific segments of time.
 Despite that, it is perfectly reasonable to tie a countdown or similar gimmick to
conflict rounds (such as a six-section Clock named “collapsing tower” that gets ticked
at the end of each round — you don't want to be there when it fills up).
2
GAME RULES
63
W
CHAPTER
Since turns do not belong to specific characters, you may
switch the order of your actions from round to round.
For instance, a sorceress who took the last turn during a
round and found an enemy to be Vulnerable to her ice magic
can go first and finish them off quickly!
This is a fundamental aspect of Fabula Ultima's conflict gameplay, and groups
that learn to coordinate their actions will perform much better than those in
which everyone is focusing on an individual strategy.
DYNAMIC TURN ORDER
Much like any game that limits the amount of “moves” a character can perform
before their opponents get a chance to act, Fabula Ultima rewards you for being
clever in how resources are used.
 If you are the Game Master, don't stage conflicts where one side is vastly
outnumbered: they will quickly be overwhelmed.
 Some powerful creatures have the ability to take several turns during each
round — these are known as elites and champions (see page 295). These
creatures still follow the normal rules for alternating turns, but take the
place of multiple normal foes.
THE ACTION ECONOMY
If you are the Game Master, it can be hard to remember
which adversaries still need to take their turn.
An excellent solution is to have enemies take their turns in
descending initiative order, from fastest to slowest — simply
write that down and apply it to each round.
This will make enemies slightly more predictable, but also allows you to focus
on more important aspects of the conflict.
OPTIONAL: ENEMY INITIATIVE
64
W
SPACE AND DISTANCES
In true console JRPG fashion, and in line with this game's cinematic approach, conflict
scenes assume characters to be able to reach each other quite easily.
There are a few important things to say about this:
d ACTIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS
Keep distances and movements abstract in your descriptions. If you want to rush past
the golems and snatch a cursed grimoire from the wizard's hands, for instance, you can
roll for that right away — it doesn't matter whether you were ten, twenty, or fifty steps
away, all that matters is who, or what, is going to try and stop you.
d ATTACKS
The big difference between melee and ranged attacks isn't in the distance they can
cover, but in the various Skills they interact with and the ability (or inability) to target
flying enemies and similarly elusive creatures.
When the martial artist in your group performs an attack that targets foes who are in
wildly different locations, you shouldn't question the feasibility of it — if anything, the
cool part is describing what the attack looks like!
If you're thinking that fragile characters are made even more vulnerable by this
approach, you are partially right; but that's where the Guard action (page 70) and the
Protect and Provoke Skills (pages 197 and 195) really shine — the ability to take a
blow for your comrades becomes critical to victory in battle.
d SPLIT SCENES
If the conflict scene involves locations that are far away from each other — say, if
you are distracting the Pirate Queen with your conversational skills while your
allies silently board her ship — you must first choose which characters will act in
each location; then, proceed with the conflict scene and "cut" between the different
locations as prompted by the initiative order.
Normally, characters in different locations will not be able to affect or interact
with each other, but sometimes the two conflict scenes will merge into one as the
characters eventually regroup.
2
GAME RULES
65
W
CHAPTER
d OKAY, BUT...
There are situations in which distances and positions are supposed to play an
important role: what if there's a sniper atop a tower? What if a terrible ritual tears
open a chasm in the middle of the battlefield?
The advice boils down to the following:
 Don't overcomplicate things. Play to this game's strengths, and avoid situations in
which suspension of disbelief becomes too strained.
 Sometimes, experiment. If you want to introduce distance as an important element
in the game, treat it as a "puzzle" that can be solved in creative ways while the
conflict progresses. For instance, you might make melee attacks useless in a battle
between two flying galleons — at that point, engaging in close combat would require
approaching and boarding the enemy ship... time for a Clock!
In the end, the most important thing to remember is that conflicts shouldn't be
resolved through careful movement and positioning, but through clever use of the
character's Skills and actions.
66
W
ACTIONS
The chart on the right summarizes the various actions available during a conflict;
these are explained in detail over the course of this section.
There's something important that should always be kept in mind when performing
an action: that action isn't just a simple gesture, it's the main focus of your turn and a
precise tactical choice. When you Attack, you perform a full offensive maneuver; when
you Study, you focus your attention and try to obtain critical information, and so on.
MINOR ACTIVITIES
There are a lot of minor gestures and operations that can be performed on your
turn, alongside your main action; the Game Master has final say on what you can
accomplish, but you'll generally be able to squeeze in at least one of the following:
 Pick up an item from the ground and/or drop something you are holding.
When you pick up an accessory, a shield, or a weapon, you may immediately equip
it — provided you have a free slot and are able to equip the item in question (for more
information on this, see page 122).
If you drop an equipped item, you will no longer have it equipped.
If you want to properly rearrange your gear, you must perform the Equipment action.
 Quickly throw an item you are holding to another character.
 Perform a minor interaction with the environment: open an unlocked door, pull a
lever, or kick down a wooden plank to bridge a gap.
All of these may be performed before, after, and sometimes during the main action of
your turn — again, the Game Master is responsible for adjudicating what is feasible
during a single turn. Be generous whenever possible.
If what you're doing requires a Check, then it's probably your main action for the turn.
Everything a character does to inject style and uniqueness in their actions will
virtually take no time — complex blade choreographies, magical chants, the mixing
of alchemical ingredients before throwing a potion and any similarly flavorful
descriptions should be encouraged, not penalized!

d ATTACK
A character may spend an action to perform an offensive maneuver using one of the
weapons they have available.
O OW Choose a target for your attack.
You must know the position of the target and be able to see them.
You must be able to reach the target with the weapon you are using; flying
enemies, for instance, cannot be reached by melee attacks.
1
W
If you hit the target, you deal damage based on the formula indicated by the
weapon you attacked with. This will generally be a sum of your Accuracy Check's
High Roll and a fixed value based on the weapon's power.
For a list of common weapons, see page 132.
3
OW
Perform an Accuracy Check using the formula indicated by the weapon you are
attacking with. The Difficulty Level is equal to the target’s Defense score. If you
succeed, you hit the target; if you fail, it means they managed to anticipate,
evade or negate your offensive.
 A fumble indicates an automatic failure and a critical success means you hit
your target regardless of their Defense. They also generate opportunities.
 The Game Master may apply situational modifiers (+2 or -2) to your
Accuracy Check based on especially favorable or hindering circumstances.
2
OW The target loses a number of Hit Points equal to the damage you dealt.
This may be modified by their Affinity with the damage type (page 92):
 A Vulnerable target loses twice the normal amount of Hit Points.
 A Resistant target loses half the normal amount of Hit Points.
 An Immune target loses no Hit Points.
 An Absorbing target recovers Hit Points equal to the damage suffered.

CHAPTER
Example: Our heroes are fighting a group of skeletons. Montblanc the knight charges
towards the nearest undead and swings his powerful waraxe. The Accuracy Check
requires a roll of【 MIG + MIG】, which in Montblanc's case means rolling two d10s:
the knight gets a 6 and a 9, for a total of 15 — more than enough to hit the enemy’s
Defense score of 11.
The waraxe deals damage equal to【 HR + 14】; since the highest of the two dice was
a 9, the total is 23 damage.
FREE ATTACKS
Some game effects allow you to perform free attacks. These follow the procedure on
the previous page but generally take place as part of a different action.
A few Skills and effects might even let you perform a free attack with weapons that
aren't part of your equipped items!
MULTI
When you perform an attack with the multi property, you may select as many different
targets as the specific weapon or effect allows — multi (2) lets you target up to two
different creatures, for instance. You perform a single Accuracy Check and compare it
to the Defense of every target, determining which of them were hit. Rolling a critical
success means you hit all your targets, while a fumble means you miss all of them.
Finally, apply the normal damage calculation to each target.
TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING
When you perform the Attack action, if you have two weapons of the same Category
equipped (such as two swords or two firearms), you may declare that you are attacking
with both.
You perform the two attacks in any order you prefer and they may both be aimed at the
same target or different targets, but the following penalties apply:
 Both attacks lose the multi property (if they had it) and cannot gain it.
 When calculating damage for both attacks, the High Roll (HR) is always treated as
being equal to 0.
You cannot use two-weapon fighting when performing a free attack.
70
W
d EQUIPMENT
When you use this action, you may store any number of your equipped items in your
backpack, and you may take any number of items from your backpack and equip them.
The only thing you can't equip or put away is armor — there's simply not enough time
for that during a single action. Still, the Game Master might allow you to remove or
equip a suit of armor if you spend several turns on it.
Remember, equipped items are always at the ready: you don't need to perform this
action to start a battle with your equipped weapon drawn, for instance.
For more information on equipping items, see page 122.
d GUARD
When using this action, you focus your attention on defending your teammates and
thwarting enemy tactics.
You gain all of the following benefits until the start of your next turn:
 You gain Resistance to all damage types, regardless of their source (see page 92 to
learn more about damage Affinities).
 Whenever you perform an Opposed Check against another character in the scene, you
gain a +2 bonus to your Result (regardless of who initiated the Check).
 You may also choose to cover another creature present on the scene. If you do, that
creature cannot be targeted by melee attacks until the start of your next turn — this
effect will also end if you die, leave the scene, or are knocked unconscious.
You cannot cover a creature that is already covering someone.
Even if you gain the ability to perform multiple actions during your turn (or to perform
the Guard action for free as part of another effect), the Guard action can only be
performed once per turn and its benefits never stack.

CHAPTER
d HINDER
You force an opponent into a disadvantageous position. This may represent a variety
of actions: a feint, a diversion, or even a stinging remark.
Once you have described your approach, you perform a Check against your target, with
a fixed Difficulty Level of 10 — the Game Master will determine the relevant Attributes
based on your description.
Example: Princess Camilla has challenged the Death Knight Brandon to a duel. She
circles the imposing warrior and attempts to put the light of the sun behind her,
hoping to dazzle him — the Game Master calls for a【 DEX + INS】 Check.
If your Check succeeds, you inflict one of the following status effects upon the loser:
dazed, shaken, slow, or weak. Your choice.
For more information on status effects, see page 94.
Back to the example above: Camilla gets a critical success and decides to inflict slow
on the Death Knight. She also generated an opportunity — which she immediately
spends to send Brandon's sword flying from his hand.
d INVENTORY
You produce an item from your inventory and immediately use that item as part of the
same action: you might give a potion to one of your allies or slip them a refreshing
balm during a tense negotiation, for instance.
 If the item you want to use requires you to be close to the target and something or
someone bars your way, the Game Master may ask for a Check.
 If you use an item whose effects include a free attack against one or more targets,
you perform this free attack as part of the Inventory action.
The rules for Inventory Points are explained on page 104.
Note that you can perform this action even if you have items equipped in both hands.
72
W
d OBJECTIVE
You use this action when you want to make progress towards one of your goals within
the conflict — either one you had established at the start of the scene, or one you just
realized you want to achieve. You might make an attempt at negotiation, sneak past a
group of guards, begin work on a magical Ritual, grab a target and try to immobilize
them, pull a lever to activate a mechanism, and so on.
OW Describe what you want to accomplish and how you intend to approach it.
Needless to say, you can only pursue a goal if you have a reasonable way to
achieve it — the Game Master has final say on which actions can be performed,
but should do their best to allow a variety of different approaches.
1
If your goal is simple enough
— such as leaping past a chasm
or climbing a rope — you will
likely accomplish it with a single
successful Check.
OW
Since Objective gets you closer to what you want to achieve within the conflict,
it will always require a Check.
 If your goal is opposed by another participant in the conflict scene, the
Check will be an Opposed Check against them. Even if multiple participants
can oppose you, only one of them will perform the Check — this should be
the most capable among your adversaries.
 Otherwise, it will be an Attribute Check.
2
OW
If your Check is successful, you alter the Clock in your favor — which, based on
the Clock in question, means filling or erasing a certain number of sections, as
previously explained on page 53:
 One section for succeeding.
 An additional section for beating the Difficulty Level or the opponent's roll
by 3 or more, or two additional sections for beating it by 6 or more.
3
Most of the time, your goal will
be complex enough to involve
the use of a Clock — especially if
achieving it brings you closer to
winning the conflict.

CHAPTER
Example: In the depths of a magitech laboratory, the warrior monk Silida is busy
keeping a rampaging stone golem away from her allies — the mage Ricard and the
arcane fencer Nethis.
Seeing how Silida is having trouble withstanding the golem's powerful attacks, Nethis
decides to work on a new goal for this conflict: there are a variety of magical crystals
surrounding them, and she wants to channel their power into the golem and overload
its core, shutting down most of its functions.
Since Nethis can wield magic, the Game Master is okay with the plan and establishes
a six-section Clock: once completed, the golem's core will be properly fried — the
Game Master says she will handle this by permanently decreasing all of the golem's
Attribute dice by one size.
When you use Objective to intervene on a Clock, it is extremely important to describe
what your character does — the Game Master has final say on which actions can
influence the Clock.
Back to the previous example: The kind of effect Nethis wants to accomplish is
definitely magical — but does this mean Silida, being unable to cast spells, cannot
influence the Clock?
Absolutely not!
For instance, she might use Objective and strike at the golem's frontal plate, which
houses its core, to expose it and increase the flow of magical energy. Maybe she won't
fill as many sections (the Golem is pretty good at opposing physical Checks, and this
isn't exactly an optimal strategy), but it will still help.
GOAL CLOCKS IN A CONFLICT SCENE
As the Game Master, you are responsible for assigning Clocks to goals and determining
how many sections they should have — use the table below as a guideline.
For detailed examples of conflict goals and Clocks, see page 78.
Sections Objective Once filled...
4 Minor Provides a minor or temporary advantage.
6 to 8 Major Provides a decisive and permanent advantage.
10 to 12 Resolutive Allows you to win the conflict.
74
W
d SPELL
You use this action to cast a spell you have learned.
For more information on magic and spells, see page 114.
d STUDY
This is a useful action when you want to know more about who or what you're dealing
with. First of all, tell the Game Master what you want to know about the subject of your
actions — be it an item, a person, a creature or even a location.
You will then perform an Open Check — generally【 INS + INS】, but there might
be times in which different Attributes make sense, such as【 INS + WLP】 to lure an
adversary into talking too much. The Game Master chooses the Attributes based on
the approach; the Result will determine what kind of information you gain access to.
Result Information Equates to...
7+ Basic A subtle hint, useful but a bit too broad.
10+ Complete A complete answer, with no room for doubt.
13+ Detailed A complete answer, and a useful detail related to it.
16+ Encyclopedic Literally everything one could possibly know about it.
Once you have studied someone or something in this way, you cannot ask the same
question again. That said, you are free to investigate other aspects of the same subject.
Example: During an audience with Duchess Ylemin, the thief Valea wants to know
more about the noblewoman's desires — surely she has a price.
Valea gets a 14 on her Check, discovering that the Duchess has a passion for antique
jewelry, as revealed by the rings she wears. While looking at her right hand, Valea
notices a portion of paler skin — could she have lost one of her treasures?
If you want to use this action to study an NPC's profile and statistics, see page 319.

CHAPTER
d SKILL
Some Skills and effects require you to "use an action" to activate them; in these cases,
the Skill action must be performed. If you ever decide to use one such Skill outside a
conflict, it will generally require five to ten seconds.
d OTHER
In addition to the ones listed above, characters might attempt all sorts of creative
actions within a turn, provided these aren't particularly complex or time-consuming
operations.
The details and resolution of these unique actions must be negotiated between the
Player and the Game Master; most of the time, the simple act of clearly stating what
you want to accomplish and how you want to do it will lead you to realize that an
existing action is already the best fit for it.
Conflicts generally represent fast-paced scenes in which
characters have limited ability to speak and discuss a
complex plan or course of action, but this shouldn’t apply to
the Players who are controlling those same characters.
Always keep the following in mind:
 First, the characters are heroes and adventurers. This means they have
likely discussed strategy and tactics before, perhaps around a campfire or
while marching through the woods; not to mention the fact that movies and
TV shows often portray heroes elaborating a strategy on the spot, as time
seemingly freezes.
 Secondly, this approach makes for a more relaxed atmosphere at the table, in
line with the general optimistic tones of the game.
Ultimately, the choice of exactly how much dialogue and strategizing is allowed
during conflicts and similar situations rest on the shoulders of the entire group:
a “sweet spot” needs to be collectively found.
DIALOGUE AND TACTICS
76
W
TEAMWORK
When a Player Character performs a Check during a conflict scene, any other Player
Character who is able to help them and hasn't already taken a turn during the current
round may choose to lend the active character a hand.
If anyone does, the Check turns into a Group Check (see page 50), but with a few key
differences:
 Each helper becomes a supporting character in that Group Check, while the active
Player Character is treated as the leader.
 Every Support Check is automatically successful.
 Each character who supported the leader is then considered as having taken their
turn within the round — in other words, you can only help if you haven't already
taken your turn, and doing so will "burn" your ability to act during that same round.
Choose wisely.
Note that this option can apply to any kind of Check, including Accuracy Checks, Magic
Checks, and Opposed Checks! This is a great way to represent characters working
together to overcome a powerful opponent — when you can't strike a flying target
with your sword, you might clear the path for your archer or help them anticipate the
enemy's movements!

CHAPTER
ENDING A CONFLICT
As with any scene in the game, the Game Master has the right to declare the ending
of a conflict. This generally happens when one side has prevailed, when everyone is
no longer able to oppose them, or when the participants negotiate some sort of truce.
 Remember: once people find an agreement, there's no conflict anymore — until they
later regret or reconsider said agreement, at least.
 Sometimes, the end of a conflict scene might mark the beginning of a different one.
It is not uncommon for a brutal battle to turn into a chase as the losing side retreats,
or a failed negotiation might turn to violence. Some characters could even have this
change as their conflict goal if they excel at a specific type of situation instead of the
current one.
 When a conflict ends, all effects that last "until the end of the scene" will also cease to
be. Keep this in mind when deciding whether you should switch to a different conflict
or simply let the current conflict evolve in a different direction.
In the end, remember that conflicts should only be used for high-stake moments and
aren't the default resolution method for every tense situation.
TURN-RELATED EFFECTS
Effects that concern themselves with "the start of a character's turn" or "the end of a
character's turn" follow a set of specific rules:
 The effect ends automatically when the conflict scene reaches its conclusion.
 The effect also ends if you die, fall unconscious, or leave the scene.
 If an effect begins, ends or recharges at the start or at the end of a character's turn
(such as the Guard action on page 70 or the Protect Skill on page 197), that effect
also begins, ends or recharges immediately if you help another character through
teamwork (see previous page).
If such an effect is somehow used outside a conflict scene (this doesn't happen often,
but it's still a possibility), it will last for a few seconds – enough to influence the
outcome of a single Check, generally.
78
W
SAMPLE GOAL CLOCKS
While the explanation for the Objective action on page 72 should give a pretty good
idea of how it should be used, below are examples of creative strategies that can be
used during conflicts.
When adjudicating whether the active character is performing an Attribute Check
against a set Difficulty Level or an Opposed Check against another character that is
present on the scene, remember that there is no limit to how many times a character
may oppose an Objective action within the same round.
A single defender with high Attributes can still prove challenging even when severely
outnumbered.
d BRING IT DOWN
While fighting against a winged dragon, the heroes decide to work together to keep it
permanently on the ground and within reach of melee weapons.
This is a major goal since it will make the battle much easier but will not end it by
itself. The Clock should probably have 6 sections. Possible actions would be...
 Use【 DEX + WLP】 to bravely taunt and lure the dragon near the ground, striking
when it's nearby. You will surely gain a +2 bonus if you are carrying something the
dragon desires!
 If armed with a ranged weapon, use【 DEX + INS】 to aim at a wing and wound the
muscles governing its movements.
 Use【 INS + WLP】 to help your group retreat towards a narrow canyon where the
dragon will have trouble maneuvering.
 If the dragon is temporarily within reach, such as after someone attempted the first
approach on this list, use【 MIG + MIG】 to wrestle it and pin it down!
Most of these Checks will be performed against the dragon's own Checks, but the
Game Master might also decide that the second approach must be made against the
dragon's Defense score.

CHAPTER
d CATCH THE THIEF
Heading towards their rooms in Caralon Castle, the heroes spot a suspicious figure at
the end of a corridor — and in their hands is the powerful artifact known as the Skyglass,
the most precious treasure of Caralon's royal bloodline! The group immediately jumps
into action, and a chase scene begins!
The Player Characters want to reach and stop the thief, which is a resolutive goal; the
Game Master sets this Clock at 10 sections. Possible actions would be...
 Use【 DEX + INS】 to anticipate the thief's movements and cut them off.
 Use【 DEX + MIG】 to bolt forward and grab the thief before they get too far.
 Use【 INS + INS】 to recall the layout of the palace corridors and tell the nearby guards
where you think the thief might be heading.
 If capable of casting spells, use【 INS +
WLP】 to summon a glowing orb that
will follow the fleeing thief.
 Use【 MIG + WLP】 to intimidate the
thief and cause them to stumble or
hesitate.
These Checks will be performed against
the thief; once the Clock reaches 10, the
group will have cornered the mysterious
figure — but this might lead to a battle!
Similarly, the thief has a Clock of their
own: thanks to a significant head start
on the heroes, the thief's Clock has 8
sections only. If the thief manages
to fill this Clock, they will flee the
scene with the Skyglass!
80
W
d CONVINCE THE QUEEN
The heroes need to persuade the Queen of Armorica that attacking the Imperial forces
tomorrow would be a suicidal maneuver. For some reason, the Queen's advisor is
stubbornly pushing for an immediate strike.
This is a resolutive goal and, given the importance of the scene, the Clock should have
12 sections. Possible actions would be...
 Use【 INS + WLP】 to present your reasons to the Queen. If you have witnesses or
items that reinforce your position, they will grant you a +2 bonus.
 Use【 INS + MIG】 to present a possible strategy and offer your battle prowess to the
Queen and her people, were she to reconsider tomorrow's attack.
 Use【 WLP + WLP】 to launch yourself into a passionate speech, attempting to win
the hearts of the bystanders. If you helped the people of Armorica in the past, you
will receive a +2 bonus.
 Use【 INS + WLP】 to lure the advisor into saying too much. To get a bonus on this
Check, you might first Study the advisor and identify his Traits and motives.
The majority of these Checks will be performed against the advisor, but the third
approach might also be made against the difficulty of "the room".
The advisor also has a Clock of his own which, once completed, will have the heroes
banished! This Clock has 12 sections — the same size as the heroes'.

CHAPTER
d KEEP THEM OUT
While facing off against a powerful necromancer, the heroes are swarmed by hordes
of zombies, making the battle much more dangerous. If only they could get a couple of
rounds without new undead arriving on the scene!
This is a minor goal and the Clock has 4 sections. Possible actions would be...
 Use【 DEX + MIG】 to quickly barricade a door to the room.
 If capable of casting light-type spells, use【 INS + WLP】 to keep the undead at bay.
 Use【 MIG + MIG】 to physically block the zombies and push them back.
Most of the above Checks will be performed against the zombies, but the necromancer
might oppose the second approach with some magic of his own.
d STOP THE RITUAL
This time, the heroes aren't pursuing a goal of their own — instead, they are trying to
stop a powerful witch from reaching the conclusion of a dangerous Ritual, and all this
while fighting against the witch's summoned beasts.
This is a resolutive goal for the witch, and the Clock has 10 sections. This time, the
Player Characters' goal is to prevent the Clock from filling while they battle the witch.
Possible actions would be...
 Use【 DEX + INS】 to line up a shot with an elemental bow or pistol and disrupt the
flow of soul energy.
 If capable of casting spells, use【 INS + WLP】 to manipulate the magic of the Ritual.
 Use【 DEX + MIG】 to pick up one of the witch's minions and fling it towards her or
inside the magic circle, causing a distraction.
 Use【 MIG + WLP】 to appear dangerous enough that the witch will momentarily have
you, and not the Ritual, as her top priority!
Most of these Checks will be made directly against the witch, although the third
approach might instead be made against the minion; the witch herself is so powerful
that her Clock automatically fills by 1 section at the end of each round — and she can
also choose to Objective on her turn to speed things up.
82
W
d AMBUSHES AND SURPRISE ROUNDS
Normally, initiative already takes care of which characters in a conflict are more aware
of their surroundings and can promptly react to danger; however, if one side gets the
jump on their foes, the Game Master may opt to give those characters a free round of
actions before anyone else can act.
This is known as a surprise round.
 This optional rule greatly favors the ambushers; a full round of actions is a massive
advantage. If you don't like the possibility of a character being defeated before even
being able to contribute to the conflict, don't use this rule.
 If you are using Superiority Points, a surprise round can become even more dangerous
if the ambushers manage to overwhelm their foes with additional actions.
See next page for the mechanics governing Superiority Points.
d PLAYERS OUTSIDE THE CONFLICT
If one or more Players are controlling no characters during a conflict scene, they can
still influence its outcome: once per conflict round after any character performs a
Check, a Player whose character is not present on the scene can choose a single
die rolled in that Check and force it to be rerolled. Multiple Players can even work
together to have the same die be rerolled more than once.
The goal of this rule is to keep Players involved even when their characters are absent
from the conflict scene or have been defeated.
If you use this optional rule, describe how your character is "fighting in spirit" alongside
their ally and helping them overcome the challenge!
Below you can find a few options for customizing conflict
scenes in your game. Any number of these can be adopted,
as long as the entire group agrees on them; you also have
the option to use them only during specific conflicts that you
think would benefit from an additional tactical layer.
OPTIONAL CONFLICT RULES
2
GAME RULES
83
W
CHAPTER
d BATTLE SUPERIORITY
This optional rule adds another layer of strategy to battles and rewards the clever use
of elemental attacks and Affinities.
If you use this rule, all participants in the conflict gain access to a special resource:
Superiority Points. These points are shared by the entire team, which means any
Superiority Points you gain may be spent by you or your allies.
Characters can gain Superiority Points in four different ways:
 Whenever you deal damage to one or more enemies, if one or more of those enemies
are Vulnerable to the damage you deal, your team gains 1 Superiority Point.
 Whenever you suffer damage, if you are Immune or Absorb that damage type, your
team gains 1 Superiority Point.
 Whenever you roll a critical success, your team gains 1 Superiority Point.
 Whenever you roll a fumble, the opposing team gains 1 Superiority Point.
A character may spend one Superiority Point to perform an additional action on their
turn, making this optional rule a dangerous addition!
However, there are three important rules governing Superiority Points:
 A character may only spend 1 Superiority Point per turn, regardless of the number of
Superiority Points available to their team.
 Whenever your team is about to gain a Superiority Point, if the opposing team has
one or more Superiority Points, instead you will gain no Superiority Point and they
will lose one Superiority Point.
 A team can never have more than 5 Superiority Points; any Superiority Points in
excess will simply be wasted.
Note that this rule is more advantageous to the Player Characters than their enemies
since Player Characters usually do not have damage Vulnerabilities.
You might want to employ a tracker such as the one shown below, and move a coin
or token back and forth to remember how many points are available to each team:
+5 +4 +3 +2 +1 0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5
84
W
In Fabula Ultima, a character’s general well-being is represented by two parameters:
Hit Points and Mind Points. If you are familiar with video games, you will no doubt
have encountered similar terms — but in this game, they work a bit differently than
what you might be used to.
HIT POINTS
Abbreviated as HP, this number indicates a character’s vital energy, fighting spirit, and
general body health, as well as their ability to take a beating and withstand physical
pain and fatigue. You should not see Hit Points as a measure of a character's physical
integrity, however — losing them does not directly translate into wounds or severe
physical harm.
One could describe Hit Points as a “shield” that protects characters from suffering that
final blow that would knock them out of a fight. Bruises, cuts, and burns are all ways to
portray this in the game fiction — the moment HP gets to 0, however, is when we see
the antagonist's blade find an opening and tear through the hero's armor.
 Current HP. This is how many Hit Points a character has at the moment. This number
can never go below 0, nor can it go above the character’s maximum HP.
 Maximum HP. A character’s current Hit Points can never be brought above this value.
If a character’s maximum HP value is 50 and they currently have 40 HP, an item
restoring 60 HP will still leave them at 50 HP, not 100.
 Crisis. This number is equal to half of a character's maximum HP, rounded down.
If your current HP is at or below this number, your are considered "in Crisis", which
means you're not looking good — you're having a bad day and it shows.
For instance, a character with 65 maximum HP will be in Crisis if they have 32 Hit
Points or less.
Some game effects activate when you enter Crisis, and others remain active as long
as you are in Crisis.
 0 HP. If a character’s current Hit Points reach 0, their fighting spirit has broken. They
will face different consequences depending on their role in the story — a Player
Character, a Villain, or a normal Non-Player Character.
For detailed information on what happens when a character reaches 0 Hit Points, take
a look at page 86.
HIT POINTS AND MIND POINTS
2
GAME RULES
85
W
CHAPTER
MIND POINTS
Abbreviated as MP, this number measures a character’s inner force, magical potential,
and ability to focus. In the game, Mind Points are often spent to fuel magic or to
perform heroic feats that verge on the superhuman.
 Current MP. This is how many Mind Points a character has at the moment. This
number can never go below 0, nor can it go above the character’s maximum MP.
 Maximum MP. A character’s current Mind Points can never be brought above this
value.
 Spending MP. Spells require you to spend Mind Points to cast them, as do several
other abilities. You can only do so if you have enough MP to pay for the full cost;
for instance, you cannot cast a spell with a cost of 10 MP if you only have 9 MP left.
 0 MP. If a character’s current Mind Points reach 0, they are mentally exhausted but
suffer no other consequence — aside from being unable to use spells and abilities
that consume MP.
86
W
When a character’s Hit Points fall to 0, the dangers and harm they endured have
become unbearable. Will they break? Will they run?
Depending on their role within the story, defeated characters will have different
options available to them.
NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS
When a Non-Player Character’s Hit Points reach 0, that character loses all will to fight.
Whoever defeated them gets the right to determine their fate: they may be captured,
forced to flee, knocked unconscious, or even slain.
Example: Yezma lands her final blow against a magically tainted boar, reducing its
Hit Points to 0. Now that the creature is defeated, Yezma must decide its fate — she
knows, however, that the great beast had turned aggressive only because of the arcane
corruption plaguing its mind and body. Because of this, Yezma decides to spare the
creature and simply scare it off, in the hope of finding a way to restore its mind later on.
This being said, some creatures might simply be destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit
Points — constructs such as golems and robots will cease to function, elemental
beings will vanish or dissipate, and undead often crumble to dust.

CHAPTER
VILLAINS
Some Non-Player Characters are a bit more important than others — these are
Villains, the main antagonists in the story. You will find more information about them
starting on page 100, but what you need to know right now is that they enjoy several
privileges when compared to normal NPCs.
When reduced to 0 Hit Points, a Villain must choose one of two options: escaping or
surrendering.
d ESCAPING
Villains have a pool of special points, mirroring the Player Characters' Fabula Points:
these are called Ultima Points (see page 101). When reduced to 0 Hit Points, a Villain
may spend 1 Ultima Point and safely disappear from the scene; the Game Master
describes how this happens.
Example: Held at gunpoint by the sky pirate Morgan, Commander Duna grins and
leaps from the airship's deck, plummeting towards the ocean below. But when Morgan
leans over the railing to see where the armored warrior fell, he's clinging to a large
winged salamander. "You win this battle, pirate!" he shouts, before the powerful beast
carries him away towards the capital.
If a Villain has no Ultima Points left, they may still escape by escalating into a more
dangerous version of themselves (see page 102).
d SURRENDERING
The Villain surrenders and is treated as any other Non-Player Character; their fate
rests in the hands of those who defeated them. In general, a Villain will only choose
this option if it's the only choice they have left; if the Player Characters show mercy
to a Villain, they might even earn a new ally — this would also be a spectacular way to
introduce a new Player Character in the group.

PLAYER CHARACTERS
Like Villains, Player Characters follow their own special rules. When reduced to 0 Hit
Points, a Player Character must either Sacrifice themselves or Surrender.
d SACRIFICE
When reduced to 0 Hit Points, a Player Character may give their life in order to
accomplish a seemingly impossible deed, such as putting an end to a centuries-old
curse, temporarily taking away a demigod's powers, or single-handedly holding off a
small army to make sure their allies can flee.
You may only sacrifice yourself if at least two of the following are true:
 A Villain (see page 100) is present on the scene.
 Your sacrifice would benefit a character you have a Bond towards.
 You believe your sacrifice would make the world a better place.
The details of the sacrifice are negotiated between you and the Game Master — you
should narrate your heroic demise together. There is no fixed limit on what a sacrifice
may accomplish: you can and should go overboard with this, especially as you will
permanently lose your character.
It is important to note that Player Characters who sacrifice themselves have accepted
their death and normally cannot be brought back to life (see below), because they
peacefully became one with the stream of souls. It isn't a bad way to go.
In the cosmology of Fabula Ultima, the spirits of the
deceased generally return to the stream of souls that
permeates the world — but some might be trapped by evil
sorcery, transported to other dimensions, or even possess a
will strong enough to retain their identity after death.
The mechanics of the game do not give you the option of bringing characters
back to life for two main reasons: firstly, the death of a Player Character should
be meaningful; and secondly, the mystery of the afterlife should be something
you explore and shape together as part of your story.

CHAPTER
d SURRENDERING
A Player Character who Surrenders falls unconscious and can no longer act nor affect
the scene with effects or abilities, even if their Hit Points are brought above 0 (if the
scene is a conflict, remove them from its participants). The Game Master cannot kill a
character who Surrenders, but may impose a consequence from the list below or one
that fits the situation, either now or later. If multiple characters Surrender — or worse,
if the entire group bites the dust! — the GM may impose separate consequences or a
single, dramatic plot twist (treat it like a "scripted defeat" in a videogame)!
Example: As the last hero bites the dust, Commander Kelta grins. "I'd love to get rid
of you once and for all, but I have a busy day. You will never make it to the village in
time! The Skyglass will shortly be in the Empress' hands."
While surrendering will never kill your character, the Game Master can still impose
heavy consequences. Given the general mood of Fabula Ultima, however, permanent
or crippling injuries should be avoided.
 When a Player Character chooses to Surrender, they immediately gain 2 Fabula Points.
 At the start of the next scene in which they appear, the Player Character regains
consciousness and recovers an amount of Hit Points equal to their Crisis score.
Sample Consequences of Surrendering
Darkness You must change your Theme to one of the following: Anger, Doubt,
Guilt, or Vengeance — your choice.
Despair The enemy gets to make a decisive move, or the heroes lose the faith
and approval of an important person or group.
Loss Something incredibly precious, such as a magical artifact, a loved
person, or an ancient and important heirloom, is taken from you.
Resentment
You are forced to erase one of your Bonds and replace it with a Bond
towards a character chosen by the Game Master. This new Bond must
be of hatred, inferiority, or mistrust — your choice.
Separated You are no longer with your allies. You might be captured, dragged
away, lost, or stranded in some unknown location.
"At the time, I could not disobey. No... I chose not to.
But today, I shall no longer allow you to do as you please!"

The heroic life can take a heavy toll on Player Characters; they often need to rest and
recover their energy. Depending on the location, characters have access to different
options for resting.
RESTING IN THE WILDERNESS
When far away from the safety of cities and villages, traveling on the road or exploring
a ruin, characters must have access to one of the following in order to rest:
 A magic tent (see page 104) created by spending 4 Inventory Points. One tent is
enough for the entire group.
 Hospitality from someone friendly, usually in exchange for help or money.
 A safe location where they run no risk of being attacked; perhaps a consecrated
temple, a secret room, the inside of an armored transport, or an area protected by a
magic circle.
RESTING INSIDE SETTLEMENTS
While in a village, town, or city, characters must have access to one of the following
in order to rest:
 A room inside an inn, which will cost money (see Town Services on page 125).
 Hospitality from someone friendly, usually in exchange for help or money.
THE EFFECTS OF RESTING
When a Player Character rests, they enjoy the following benefits:
 They recover all of their Hit Points and Mind Points.
 They recover from all status effects.
Generally, resting requires four to six hours of inactivity. See Rests and Pacing on the
right for more information on the consequences of resting.

CHAPTER
BONDS AND RESTING SCENES
When the heroes rest, there is a chance for calmer, more intimate roleplaying — this
is known as a resting scene. During this type of scene, Players can spend some time
roleplaying conversations and describing what their characters do while sitting near
the campfire or relaxing around town.
At the end of a resting scene, each PC may do one of the following:
 Create a new Bond towards someone or something.
 Add a new emotion to an existing Bond.
 Erase an emotion from an existing Bond and replace it with a different one.
When you add new Bonds or change their emotions, describe how and why your
character's view of others has shifted.
NON-PLAYER CHARACTER RECOVERY
These rules only apply to Player Characters; the Game Master always has full control
over Non-Player Character recovery times. In general, whenever an NPC appears on
a scene they are assumed to be at their full Hit Points and Mind Points, and with no
status effects.
While the rules for rests are very generous, spending too
much time wrapped in the warm blankets of an inn will
allow whatever danger is approaching to make the first
move undisturbed.
Inactivity should never be without consequence.
The Game Master may use Clocks to keep the Players on their toes and
foreshadow incoming threats, filling a section at the end of each rest.

In Fabula Ultima, damage generally falls into one of the following types:
Damage Icon Description
Physical ' The most common damage, caused by weapons and impacts.
Air a Caused by supernatural winds and sky monsters.
Bolt b Caused by lightning and electricity.
Dark a Caused by undead and life-destroying magic.
Earth E Caused by supernatural tremors and earth spirits.
Fire f Caused by flames, magma or intense heat.
Ice i Caused by very low temperatures and frost magic.
Light l Caused by pure and untainted spiritual energy.
Poison b Caused by poison, infections and pollution.
DAMAGE AFFINITIES
Some creatures have a particular Affinity towards certain damage types, often due to
their Species — for instance, undead creatures are Vulnerable to light damage.
 Vulnerability. If a creature is Vulnerable towards a damage type, they will lose twice
the normal amount of Hit Points.
 Resistance. If a creature Resists a damage type, they will only lose half the normal
amount of Hit Points.
 Immunity. If a creature is Immune to a damage type, they will lose no Hit Points.
 Absorption. If a creature Absorbs a damage type, they will lose no Hit Points and will
instead recover an amount of Hit Points equal to the damage they suffered.
Some game effects may cause you to gain a variety of Affinities: if a character is both
Vulnerable and Resistant to a specific type of damage, they are treated as having no
Affinity towards it. Immunity, on the other hand, always supersedes both Resistance
and Vulnerability: finally, Absorption supersedes all other Affinities.

GAME RULES

CHAPTER
EXTRA DAMAGE
Some game effects let you deal "extra damage". These effects do not apply to effects
that deal no damage of their own, only to those which already deal damage.
CHANGING DAMAGE TYPES
There are a variety of game effects that change the type of damage dealt by a spell or
weapon. When this happens, the most recent effect “overwrites” any previous changes
— and when such an effect ends, damage will return to its previous type.
Example: By default, a sword deals physical damage. If the spell Soul Weapon (page
209) is cast on that sword, it will deal light damage until the end of the scene. But if
a Cyclone infusion (page 214) is applied to an attack, that attack will deal air damage
— subsequent attacks will return to dealing light damage.
IMPROVISING DAMAGE
Damage is generally dealt by weapons, spells, or special abilities, but there can be
other situations in which characters might be harmed, such as falling from a bridge or
being buried under a pile of debris. The Game Master should use the table below to
determine the amount of damage suffered in similar occasions. The damage type will
vary depending on the circumstances, of course.
Level Minor Damage Heavy Damage Massive Damage
5+ 10 30 40
20+ 20 40 60
40+ 30 50 80
Sources of damage such as traps and hazards cannot kill a Player Character unless
they choose to sacrifice themselves; this should be portrayed as a sudden stroke of
luck or as a consequence of the character’s heroic resolve.
Example: Montblanc falls into a river of lava and is reduced to 0 Hit Points. He
surrenders and manages to land on a floating rock, but passes out because of the
heat. The current drags him away, separating him from the group.
94
W
Characters — be they PCs or NPCs — can suffer status effects during play. These will
often be a consequence of attacks and spells.
Status Effect Description
Dazed Temporarily reduces your Insight die size by one.
Enraged Temporarily reduces your Dexterity and Insight die sizes by one.
Poisoned Temporarily reduces your Might and Willpower die sizes by one.
Shaken Temporarily reduces your Willpower die size by one.
Slow Temporarily reduces your Dexterity die size by one.
Weak Temporarily reduces your Might die size by one.
CUMULATIVE STATUS EFFECTS
Different status effects that influence the same Attribute will stack — for instance,
being both dazed and enraged reduces your Insight die size by two.
That said, your Attributes cannot be reduced below a d6 size.
If a character is suffering from a status effect and receives that same status effect
again, nothing happens.
RECOVERING FROM STATUS EFFECTS
Status effects can be healed through resting or via specific spells, Skills, or items.
STATUS EFFECT IMMUNITY
If a character is immune to a given status effect, they cannot suffer it — if they become
immune to that status effect while they have it, then they immediately recover from
that status effect.
STATUS EFFECTS
2
GAME RULES
95
W
CHAPTER
The six status effects are an abstract representation of a
character’s diminished abilities. Poisoned can represent
being drunk or sick, shaken might be caused by fear or
hallucinations, slow can come from ice magic as well as
especially sticky ooze, and so on.
Many other afflictions could be treated as their own status effect, such as
being asleep or petrified: however, these are not status effects and behave
in a different way. Instead of reducing a character’s game statistics, they affect
the way that character can act within the game world. Petrified creatures, for
instance, will be unable to act.
When dealing with similar effects, rely on logic and on what makes sense given
the circumstances. Unless established by the game rules, it is the Game Master’s
job to decide which events translate to status effects and which are handled as
narrative elements.
STATUS EFFECT... OR MAYBE NOT?

Fabula Points represent the Player Characters’ ability to influence destiny and stem
directly from their heroic nature and the hardships they face.
FABULA POINTS AT CHARACTER CREATION
Each newly created character automatically receives 3 Fabula Points; any other Fabula
Points must be gained during play.
GAINING FABULA POINTS
There are four main ways a Player Character can gain Fabula Points, plus a fifth
optional method:
 If a Player Character has no Fabula Points at the start of a session, they immediately
receive 1 Fabula Point.
 Whenever a Player Character rolls a fumble on a Check, they immediately receive 1
Fabula Point.
 Whenever a Villain makes an entrance during a scene — even if it is a Game Master
scene, where the Player Characters are not present — each Player Character will
immediately receive 1 Fabula Point.
For more information on Villains, see page 100.
 Whenever a Player Character is reduced to 0 Hit Points and decides to Surrender, that
character immediately receives 2 Fabula Points.
 Whenever a Player Character invokes one of their Bonds or Traits to automatically
fail a Check (as per the optional rule on page 47), that character immediately receives
1 Fabula Point.
There is no upper limit to a character’s Fabula Points. In short, you are free to hoard
them in preparation for an “important occasion” — however, spending Fabula Points is
one of the main ways you will gain Experience Points and increase your level in the
game (see page 226).
Thus, saving them up will slow down the growth of the entire group.

CHAPTER
SPENDING FABULA POINTS
Your character's Fabula Points can be spent in a variety of ways — you have already
encountered some of them during the previous pages, but there are two more:
 Altering the current situation to your advantage in some way, by modifying or adding
elements (see next page).
 Some powerful character abilities require you to spend Fabula Points in order to
activate them.
Taking these into account, the complete list of Fabula Point uses looks like this:
Effect Fabula Point
Cost
Description
Alter the Story 1 Alter an existing element or add a new element.
Invoke Bond 1 Add Bond strength to a Check (see page 47).
Invoke Trait 1 Reroll dice during a Check (see page 46).
Use Skill varies Use a Skill that requires Fabula Points.
Fabula Points act as the core engine of the game, and
they work as both a mechanical and a narrative currency.
The more hardships and defeats you face, the more Fabula
Points you earn; and the more you spend them to overcome
obstacles and challenges, the faster your character grows.
In a way, Fabula Points represent the cycle of fate surrounding the protagonists
of the story: they gather resolve from defeat, channel that resolve through the
Traits and Bonds that make them who they are, and grow stronger for that... only
to be faced with even greater adversities.
Is this truly a neverending cycle, or is it a spiral that can lead to new hope for your
world? Only by playing the game will you be able to reach an answer!
FABULA POINTS
98
W
ALTERING THE STORY
As a Player, you can spend 1 Fabula Point to make a statement about the story. You get
to shape part of the world, its people, and its creatures, to fill in the "grey areas" and
generate an opportunity for action, tweak a detail in your favor... or even introduce a
convenient plot twist!
 If you want to change or add new details to a character, location, or item that has
already been established — such as a character, location, or item the Game Master
described or introduced — you will first need the Game Master's permission.
 If your alteration directly affects another Player Character — for instance, if you are
establishing there is a bounty on the head of one of your companions — you will first
need permission from the corresponding Player.
 You cannot use this option to contradict a statement previously made by yourself or
by another participant.
 You cannot use this option to cause mechanical changes such as gaining or altering a
Skill, switching a creature's Vulnerabilities, or inflicting a status effect on one or more
enemies. The Game Master might decide that the element you introduced grants a
mechanical advantage, but that's their call to make, not yours.
 If you introduce a new Non-Player Character this way, that character will still be
under the Game Master's control.
As with any freeform tool, this option is very powerful and may be used in a variety of
ways and "intensities" — some Players will just add a useful item on the scene, others
will come up with entire new locations and place them on the world map.
When you sit down to play, discuss what you feel comfortable with — but do your best
to embrace the adventurous (and sometimes over-the-top) nature of this rule.
Example 1: After defeating the Mirror Golem in the depths of the forest ruins, the
heroes recover a strange ivory disc bearing mysterious inscriptions. No one among
them knows how to read this ancient language; a Player decides to spend 1 Fabula
Point to state his character knows of an elderly scholar living in the countryside
nearby, who might be able to help.
Since this statement does not contradict anything previously stated by the Game
Master or by another Player, it becomes automatically true — the Player marks the
position of the scholar's tower on the map.

GAME RULES

CHAPTER
Example 2: Our heroes are searching for a massive dragon across the rocky hills
surrounding Ildefort. They finally track the monster down to a large cavern.
At that point, a Player declares she wants to spend 1 Fabula Point to state that the
creature is asleep — this will make it easier to get the drop on them.
The dragon is a creature introduced by the Game Master, which means the Player
needs permission in order to make a statement about them. The GM is okay with this,
but points out that this is no "magical sleep" and that the group will have to make
Checks in order to avoid waking up the dragon.
Example 3: Seven years ago, the warrior-sorceress Daige deserted the imperial army.
Now Daige finds herself back in the imperial capital, leading an infiltration team
determined to steal the Soul Crystal from the Empress' clutches.
While gathering information in the streets, Daige and her comrade Valincor realize
they are being followed by a city guard: the Player controlling Daige, Hannah, spends
1 Fabula Point and reveals that their pursuer is actually a member of her former unit,
Ramis. He was never a fan of imperial cruelties but remained in the army to feed his
family. Since the city guard was a character introduced by the Game Master, Hannah
needs permission — this is a huge change to the scene, but the GM is intrigued and
agrees to it.
From now on, the Game Master will still control Ramis — but the heroes have gained a
new and useful contact within the capital. However, Ramis still has a weakness: what
will he do if his family is threatened?
There is more than one side to each story.

In Fabula Ultima, Villains are powerful antagonists that will give Player Characters
a run for their money. Just as the Player Characters’ actions drive the story forward,
Villains represent the powerful threats that loom over the world — sometimes lurking
in the shadows, sometimes welcoming our protagonists with a warm and deceitful
smile, and sometimes challenging them in an all-out battle that will decide the fate
of the entire world.
Here are some good examples of Villains:
 A corrupt baron that is constantly abusing his authority.
 A ruthless entrepreneur who exploits workers and tricks them into believing it's for
their own good.
 A legendary dragon terrorizing the countryside.
 An ancient wizard who turned the locals into pigs, rats and frogs.
 A regretful sorceress seeking to erase the present and correct her past mistakes.
 A god of despair who seeks to liberate all living things from the pain of existence.
Whatever form they take, Villains are usually connected to one or more Player
Characters; sometimes this connection is thematic (as would be the case with a
ruthless Villain opposing a character's Theme of Mercy), but it can also be much more
tangible (a classic case would be a Villain who is revealed to be a Player Character's
lost sibling).
INTRODUCING VILLAINS IN THE STORY
The Game Master may introduce Villains whenever they see fit — either by adding a
completely new character to the story or by revealing that a preexisting character or
creature is a Villain.
Villains are often accompanied by henchmen or even by other Villains: two lovers
fighting side by side, a Queen and her advisor, a powerful sorcerer and his massive
golems, a bandit leader and her gang of rogues...
More information on how to create and manage Villains can be found in the Game
Master chapter, on page 254.

CHAPTER
ULTIMA POINTS
Ultima Points are the dark mirror to Fabula Points. When a Villain is introduced, the
Game Master must also decide whether that character is a minor, major, or supreme
Villain — the GM can keep this a secret or openly reveal it.
The Villain receives Ultima Points based on narrative importance:
Villain Ultima Points Examples
Minor 5 Enemy commanders, unique and infamous monsters,
and antagonists causing trouble in small settlements.
Major 10 Tyrants, powerful mages, legendary creatures, and
entities that threaten entire countries.
Supreme 15 Archdemons, immortal entities, and alien deities bent
on destruction or domination.
SPENDING ULTIMA POINTS
A Villain has three options for spending Ultima Points:
Effect Description
Escape
A Villain may spend 1 Ultima Point to safely leave the scene — the
Game Master describes how they do so, perhaps leaving a few
henchmen behind to "keep the heroes company".
Invoke Trait
After performing a Check, a Villain may spend 1 Ultima Point to
invoke one of their Traits and reroll one or both dice (this follows
the same rules seen on page 46).
Recovery
A Villain may use an action and spend 1 Ultima Point to recover from
all status effects and also recover 50 Mind Points.
While Player Characters can gain Fabula Points in several ways, Villains cannot
recharge their Ultima Points — in a way, they represent the Villain's determination and
will to pursue their objectives. A Villain with no remaining Ultima Points is no longer
a Villain and becomes equivalent to any other NPC; alternatively, they may choose to
escalate (see next page).
102
W
ESCALATION
At any time during play, the Game Master may declare that a Villain has transformed
into a new version of themselves — one with greater powers and darker ambitions.
Narratively speaking, this is the moment in which the Villain rejects a chance at
redemption and grows even more obsessive in the pursuit of their goal. The heroes
forced them into a corner, and the results have proven catastrophic.
 A minor Villain can become a major Villain.
 A major Villain can become a supreme Villain.
 A supreme Villain cannot grow any more powerful.
Following this transformation, the character is treated as an entirely new Villain;
the first time they appear during a scene, their Ultima Points will reset to a value
appropriate to their new role in the story.
 If a Villain has no Ultima Points left and is reduced to 0 Hit Points, they may
immediately escalate while still on the scene; this will allow them to recharge their
Ultima Points and no longer be forced to surrender (page 87).
 If a Villain escalates while on the scene, they are immediately treated as a new Villain
and thus award each Player Character 1 Fabula Point.
2
GAME RULES
103
W
CHAPTER
VILLAINS AND FABULA POINTS
Whenever a Villain makes an entrance during a scene, each Player Character gains 1
Fabula Point.
 Multiple identities. If a Villain has more than one identity, the heroes only receive
Fabula Points when they appear using their "antagonist persona". Once the deception
is exposed, however, they will begin awarding Fabula Points every time they appear
on a scene, whether disguised or else.
 Multiple Villains. If two or more Villains appear during the same scene, each Player
Character will gain 1 Fabula Point per Villain, up to a maximum of 3 Fabula Points per
Player Character earned this way during the same scene.
 Back-to-back scenes with Villains. If a Villain's presence extends for several
consecutive scenes, the Player Characters only gain 1 Fabula Point at the beginning,
and no additional Fabula Points for the following scenes.
Whenever the heroes are running low on Fabula Points, the Game Master should run a
Game Master scene and show a Villain in action — this is a great way to push the story
forward while also giving the heroes a bit more "fuel".
Great evil is born when good intentions
are met with mistrust and despair.
When choosing whether a Villain will escalate, the Game
Master should consider the antagonist's importance within
the story, their personality, and the way the heroes chose to
confront them: a Villain's escalation shows that the heroes
might win a conflict but still make the situation worse.
Most of the time it's best to simply let a Villain be defeated: maybe their resolve
is broken, maybe they even realized they were wrong and will turn into an ally.
Escalating your Villains sparingly will make them more memorable and also
ensure that Players feel like their actions have an impact on the world.
In general, you should only have two to four escalations per campaign.
SHOULD THIS VILLAIN ESCALATE?

Player Characters have an abstract reserve of useful gear and consumable items,
represented by Inventory Points (IP).
A character can normally carry a maximum of 6 Inventory Points; however, some
Classes and special Skills will increase this limit.
SPENDING INVENTORY POINTS
Whenever you need a consumable item from the list below, you may spend an
appropriate amount of Inventory Points to produce it from your bag and apply its
effect — all Inventory Points spent this way must come from the same character.
Once created, the item must be used immediately and is destroyed in the process; you
cannot create it and then "save it for later".
The table below lists the default inventory objects available in the game; this
information is also present on your group sheet for easier reference. The sheet also
features blank spaces where you can write custom inventory items that are unique to
your world!
The Tinkerer Class (page 210) can use Inventory Points in a variety of ways.

CHAPTER
RECHARGING INVENTORY POINTS
Characters can recharge their Inventory Points when they are in a town, village, or
other locations that allow them to purchase useful gear: the cost is 10 zenit for every
Inventory Point they want to recharge.
At the Game Master’s discretion, characters may also recharge some of their Inventory
Points in particular circumstances, such as stumbling upon an adventurer’s backpack
or being rewarded by a village for their help with local troubles.
A character’s current Inventory Points can never go above their maximum Inventory
Points — there is always a limit to how much can be carried comfortably.
SHARING INVENTORY POINTS
Characters are not allowed to redistribute Inventory Points among themselves.
GEAR AND TOOLS
All Player Characters are assumed to be carrying any gear and tools appropriate to
their Identity or befitting their role as adventurers: there’s no need to keep track of
torches, ropes, blankets and so on.
If a character needs a basic adventuring item, they will have it.
However, sometimes a character will need an item that is a bit uncommon or doesn't
really fit their Identity. When this happens, the Game Master may allow the character
to spend some Inventory Points (generally 2 to 4) in order to "miraculously" pull the
item in question out of their backpack.
Example: A character whose Identity is “Princess of Thieves” will surely carry some
quality lockpicks in her bag; on the contrary, a noble knight will probably have to
spend a couple Inventory Points to pull them out of his backpack.
Items created this way are not immediately destroyed, but characters should not be
allowed to sell them for a price higher than five times their IP cost. For instance, an
item that costs 2 IP to create should sell for 10 zenit at most.
Note that, while tools and similar gear might allow you to perform an otherwise
impossible operation, they never grant any mechanical benefit.

While conflicts may be the most memorable moments of a game session, the
exploration of the game world is another major aspect of Fabula Ultima.
At the beginning of the game, your group will create the world together (see World
Creation, on page 148); however, this does not mean you know everything about
it. While you may be familiar with the main regions and cities, there are plenty of
discoveries — and dangers! — awaiting our heroes.
TRAVELING ACROSS THE WORLD MAP
When a group embarks on a journey, the Game Master makes use of the map sheet
to track their movements. The basic unit of this system is the travel day: it is the
average distance covered during a single day on the map (assuming the characters are
traveling on foot). The length of one travel day when using your map sheet must be
established by the group during World Creation.
For each travel day required by the journey, perform the following steps:
JOURNEYS AND TRAVELS
For the sake of simplicity, travel days should always be rounded up to the next whole
number — a journey taking two and a half days is rounded up to three days, for instance.
The Game Master always has final say on how many travel days a journey will take.
O OW The Game Master determines the threat level of the areas traversed by the
group (see next page).
If more than a single threat level is present, only apply the highest.

Unless stopped by an encountered danger, the characters proceed to the next
travel day (go back to step 1) or reach their destination.

OW
Perform a travel roll by rolling the die appropriate to the chosen threat level.

 On a 1, the group makes an unexpected discovery!
The Game Master decides the location of each danger and discovery; if you
need, mark its position on your map sheet.

Sample Areas Threat Level Travel Roll

Prairies, patrolled roads, countrysides Low d8
Forests, hills, rivers Medium d10
Vast forests, mountains, open sea, swamps High d12
Deserts, frozen wastes, jungles, volcanoes Very High d20
Needless to say, a frequently patrolled area under enemy control will count as a High
or Very High danger, just like a prairie overrun by hostile monsters.
The Game Master has final say on the threat level for a given travel day.
Example: A group of heroes are leaving the village of Relde for the Kanka Hills, where
they must search for an old mining tunnel that supposedly leads to the lair of a wise
water serpent.
Liz (the Game Master) takes a look at the map and determines that the characters
will need one travel day to reach the hills, and another travel day to explore the
surrounding area in order to find the tunnel entrance.
For the first travel day, the group will cross prairies (d8) and hills (d10). Since only the
highest die has to be taken into account, Liz should roll a d10. However, there is talk
of a gang of bandits roaming the prairie: she decides this should raise the threat level
to High (d12). The die comes up a 7: a danger!
Liz has the group encounter a band of four brigands, accompanied by a Grey Howler (a
wolf-like creature). Following a quick conflict, the Player Characters manage to fend
off the attackers.
Before moving on to the next travel day, the heroes choose to use a Magic Tent and
rest, regaining their energies.
Finally, Liz rolls for the second travel day, spent exploring the hills in search of the
fabled mine: this time, the die rolled is only a d10... and she rolls a 1!
After giving it some thought, Liz describes the PCs finding an entrance to the ancient
tunnels... but they are not alone! They meet a traveling merchant by the name of Lily,
who wishes to be escorted through the mine: she seeks an audience with the serpent
herself, and will reward them with goods or information for it!

DANGERS
Characters should generally be able to overcome a danger through a series of Checks
or a conflict scene.
 An area plagued by extreme weather conditions, such as sandstorms or bitter cold.
 A polluted swamp filled with toxic miasma and ravenous undead.
 A ferocious and territorial monster, or a group of hostile creatures.
 A sudden, unfortunate encounter with a rival or antagonist.
 The risk of losing an important item.
If you need to determine damage dealt by a danger, use the table below:
Level Minor Damage Heavy Damage Massive Damage
5+ 10 30 40
20+ 20 40 60
40+ 30 50 80
Status effects are another good consequence for dangers: for instance, the polluted
swamp mentioned above might inflict poisoned.
While playing, the Game Master is free to add new landmarks,
settlements and similar features to the map sheet whenever
they feel appropriate. This usually happens when the group
encounters a new point of interest or dangerous area, or when
they learn about it from someone.
Players can also add new features and locations to the map by spending a Fabula
Point to add a new story element, as explained on page 98.

DISCOVERIES
Discoveries don’t happen that often, so the Game Master should make sure each and
every one of them is unique and useful.
 The entrance to an ancient ruin: is it guarded? What treasures are hidden here?
 A merchant caravan or a group of helpful creatures.
 A secluded village or safe haven unknown to most.
 A precious item or piece of information.
Remember that a discovery is always a good thing: even if it’s a dangerous location,
the reward it conceals should more than make up for it.
The first airship pilot, Oona Sabine,
vanished during a flight over the Whisperwoods.

The concept of a “dungeon” is a common trope in any type of RPG, tabletop and
digital alike. Generally, a dungeon is frequently — but not always! — a labyrinthine
environment, inhabited by hostile creatures... and often concealing valuable treasures
and powerful magical items, or acting as an evil antagonist's lair.
In Fabula Ultima, the term “dungeon” is used to indicate a somewhat complex location
that is worthy of being explored. It could be an abandoned mill turned into a brigand
hideout, a witch’s castle, or a network of waterways guarded by ancient golems.
Most of the time, the dungeon itself won’t be that important: why the heroes are there
and what can be found within it is what really matters. Other times, a dungeon can be
a powerful way to tell a story about those who inhabited it — and maybe hint at some
obscure truths or provide an answer to some of the game world's mysteries.
EXPLORING DUNGEONS
Depending on the size and importance of the dungeon in question, the Game Master
may adopt any of the following methods:
 Dungeon scenes. The exploration is run as a succession of key moments rather
than an inch-by-inch search of the dungeon. This works best when the layout of the
dungeon is mostly irrelevant and all that matters is what lies in its depths.
This approach is identical to default gameplay: the heroes discuss their actions and
describe what they do, the Game Master describes what goes on around them, and
Checks and conflicts take place as normal.
 Detailed exploration. The entire dungeon can be explored in its every nook and
cranny. This approach can be quite time-consuming and should only be used if the
structure and details of the place tell an important story.
For this method to work, the GM should carefully prepare the layout of the dungeon
beforehand — reserve it for locations that you're sure the PCs will explore.
 Interlude. The exploration is narrated as an interlude scene, with maybe a single
Group Check establishing whether the Player Characters encounter any obstacles or
dangers before they reach the depths of the dungeon. Use this approach if you are
short on time and if the dungeon isn't particularly important — the typical occasion
would be a minor location discovered while traveling.
Additional advice on how the Game Master should prepare material for dungeons can
be found starting on page 258.

CHAPTER
DANGER CLOCKS
The Game Master can use Clocks to keep track of incoming threats in the dungeon.
These Danger Clocks should feature a number of section based on the urgency of the
threat they represent:
 Eight sections for a threat that isn't immediately obvious and will only come true
with time — something like "crumbling temple" or "magitech system failure".
 Six sections for a threat that is quite obvious and likely to happen after a while —
such as "wandering monsters" or "poisonous fog".
 Four sections for a threat that is urgent and very likely to happen — something like
"surrounded" or "high alert" in a dungeon brimming with hostile creatures.
The Game Master may fill a Danger Clock as a consequence of failed Checks, as well as
when an event would make the threat more likely, such as when the PCs spend time
searching a room, make noise, rest inside the dungeon or draw unwanted attention.
Different Danger Clocks will be triggered by different actions and events, of course —
casting a spell might fill an "arcane overload" Clock, while searching a room is unlikely
to affect it.
As the Clock fills, the Game Master should foreshadow the incoming danger: once it is
completely filled, that threat will become active in full, and the heroes will be forced
to deal with it one way or another.

The worlds of Fabula Ultima are innately magical, bound together on an atomic
level by a stream of eternal souls. Because of this, many creatures can wield magic,
manipulating soul energy to create supernatural effects.
SPELLS AND RITUALS
Magic in Fabula Ultima falls within one of two categories: spells or Rituals.
 Spells represents codified magic formulas developed to protect warriors and
travelers: their applications are primarily offensive or defensive. They can be learned
easily and only require a brief gesture to cast, but lack flexibility.
 Rituals, on the other hand, are complex magical effects designed to overcome a
specific obstacle: whenever a Ritual is performed, it will always be started from
scratch and take several minutes to complete.
While powerful and extremely flexible, Rituals consume large amounts of Mind Points
and require difficult Magic Checks; additionally, failing a Ritual will cause the magic
to spiral out of control. While these downsides can be mitigated through time, effort,
and complex procedures, the truth remains that Ritual magic is a powerful resource...
but one that should be used sparingly.
The mechanics governing spells and Rituals can be found in the next pages.
MAGIC DISCIPLINES
This book features a total of six disciplines: Arcanism, Chimerism, Elementalism,
Entropism, Ritualism, and Spiritism. Five of these correspond to a specific Class:
Arcanist, Chimerist, Elementalist, Entropist, and Spiritist, whilst Ritualism is available
to all of these Classes, except for Arcanists.
d ARCANISM
Arcanists can project a large portion of their soul outside their bodies, forcing it to
resonate with the power left behind by ancient divine entities known as Arcana, and
manifest a fragment of their power. To access an Arcanum’s power, one must first earn
their favor: this often involves completing some sort of trial, quest, or mission.
Arcanism is a peculiar discipline that does not feature spells, but instead follows its
own unique mechanics (see the Arcanist Class on page 176). Arcanism Rituals are also
possible through the Arcane Rituals Skill.

CHAPTER
d CHIMERISM
Chimerists gain their powers from the souls of beasts and monsters; they search for
creatures able to cast spells and attempt to mimic the same effects.
Chimerism features both spells and Rituals. However, Chimerist spells must be learned
from creatures (see the Spell Mimic Skill on page 183).
d ELEMENTALISM
Elementalists can control the stream of souls that binds the four core elements of
creation: air, earth, fire, and water. They can also influence any of their combinations
and manifestations, such as magma, blizzards, deserts, or clouds.
Elementalism features both spells and Rituals.
d ENTROPISM
Entropists go beyond the stream of souls found in the world and reach for the vast
expanse of nothingness between stars. Their chaotic magic defies logic, twisting time
and space and dissipating souls, matter, and magical energy.
Entropism features both spells and Rituals.
d RITUALISM
Contrary to most other magical disciplines, Ritualism features no spells and can only
be used in Ritual form. It is a catch-all term for Rituals performed to manipulate, sense,
bind or unleash magical energy present within a location, item, mechanism, or relic.
From a certain point of view, magitech could be considered a combination of Ritualism
and technology.
d SPIRITISM
Spiritists can manipulate the raw energy found within the souls of living creatures,
influencing their emotions and manipulating their vital force: a power both miraculous
and frightening.
Spiritism features both spells and Rituals.
114
W
Spells can belong to any of the following disciplines: Chimerism, Elementalism,
Entropism, and Spiritism. The remaining two disciplines, Arcanism and Ritualism, do
not feature any spells.
Each spell description uses the format below and contains a variety of information:
SPELL MP TARGET DURATION
Ignis r 10 × T Up to three creatures Instantaneous
You unleash a searing barrage against your foes, conjuring flames out of thin air. Each
target hit by this spell suffers【 HR + 15】 fire damage.
Opportunity: Each target hit by this spell suffers shaken.
 The name of the spell, and whether it is an offensive spell (r).
See page 116 for more information on offensive spells.
 The cost of the spell in Mind Points. To cast a spell, you must have enough MP to pay
its cost; additionally, some spells allow you to spend more MP to increase the number
of targets or strengthen the effect. For instance, a spell with a cost of 10 × T will cost
you 10 Mind Points per target; the final amount of Mind Points required to cast a spell
is known as the total MP cost.
 The targets that can be affected by the spell. Most spells can target a certain number
of creatures, but others may affect different targets (such as weapons).
 A target of "Self" means the caster will use the spell on themselves, while a target
of "Special" indicates that the spell functions in a unique way described in its text,
usually affecting a variety of creatures or elements present on the scene.
 The duration of the spell. Either "Instantaneous", meaning that the spell takes
effect immediately and then dissipates, or "Scene", meaning that the spell creates an
ongoing effect lasting until the end of the scene it was cast in.
 The effect of the spell, often preceded by a flavorful description. This description has
no mechanical relevance, but can help you understand the concept behind the spell
and customize its appearance in order to fit your character.
 Spells that require a Magic Check often feature an opportunity effect. If you roll a
critical success on your Magic Check, you may spend the corresponding opportunity
to trigger this effect.

CASTING A SPELL
To cast a spell, you must fulfill the following prerequisites:
 You must be free to move your body. You can be holding items in your hands, as long
as you can move your arms.
 You must be able to speak and pronounce the invocation.
 You must have enough Mind Points to pay for the spell’s total MP cost, including any
additional MP used to enhance its effect.
 Unless you are casting a spell with a target of Self or Special, you must be able to
see your targets.
If all of the above are true, you may cast the spell.
OW
Declare which spell you want to cast among those your character has learned,
and what its effect will be.

2 If required, choose the targets for your spell.
OW
Perform the magical gestures and pronounce the formula — remember that any
nearby creatures will see and hear you.
3
OW
If the spell is an offensive (r) spell, you must also perform a Magic Check.
Elementalism, Entropism, and Spiritism Checks rely on 【INS + WLP】, while
Chimerism may choose between【 INS + WLP】 o【r MIG + WLP】.
Non-offensive spells are automatically successful and require no Check.
Fumbles and critical successes on Magic Checks generate opportunities as
normal.

4 Spend the required amount of Mind Points.
6 Apply the effects of the spell.
116
W
CASTING A SPELL FURTIVELY
Spells require precise movements and spoken incantations; they also produce visible
and fantastical effects. Because of this, everyone nearby will immediately know that
magic is being used, and who by — it is impossible to cast a spell furtively.
OFFENSIVE SPELLS
Spells marked with (r) next to their name are offensive spells.
When you cast an offensive spell, you perform the appropriate Magic Check and the
target's Magic Defense score determines the Difficulty Level. If the spell has multiple
targets, it will affect each target whose Magic Defense is equal to or lower than the
Result of your Magic Check (similarly to a multi attack). The spell will affect each target
whose Magic Defense is equal to or lower than the total Result of your Magic Check.
If you roll a critical success on the Magic Check, the spell automatically hits all targets.
CALCULATING DAMAGE AND SIMILAR EFFECTS
Several spells require you to calculate the potency of their effects using your High Roll
(HR) — to do so, simply take the highest die you rolled on your Magic Check.
The same effect will then be applied to each target.
ENDING THE EFFECTS OF A SPELL
If you cast a spell with a duration of "Scene", you can end its effect at any time. The
effect will also end if you die or fall unconscious, or if you leave the scene.
CUMULATIVE SPELL EFFECTS
If the same spell is cast more than once on a target, its effects will not stack — the
most recent casting will replace the previous one.
Example: The spell Elemental Shroud grants Resistance to one damage type chosen
among air, bolt, earth, fire, and ice. If this spell is cast on a creature granting them
Resistance to fire, and is subsequently cast again on the same creature granting them
Resistance to ice, the creature will only be Resistant to ice.
If two spells have identical effects but different names, they do not stack.

While the effects of spells and disciplines are defined by
the rules of the game, the way they manifest in your world
is something that can vary from one character to another,
and another great opportunity to inject personality into each

flowers that produce the effects of the spell.
 A spellblade might channel magic through precise blade movements.
 A sorcerer might summon a swarm of imps or pixies to torment their enemies
and assist their allies.

DESCRIBING YOUR MAGIC
118
W
By acquiring specific Classes and Skills, characters may gain the ability to use Ritual
magic belonging to different disciplines.
Each branch of Ritual magic grants you influence over different aspects of the world:
Discipline Magic Check You could use it to...
Arcanism 【WLP + WLP】Produce a magical effect based on the Arcana
you have bound.
Chimerism 【INS + WLP】 or
【MIG + WLP】
Enhance your senses, see through the eyes of an
animal, quell the fury of a monster.
Elementalism 【INS + WLP】Walk on water, shape rock, snuff out fires, cause a
rainstorm or summon powerful cyclones.
Entropism 【INS + WLP】Cause the decay of physical matter, twist the
flow of time, teleport creatures or items.
Ritualism 【INS + WLP】Extract magic from an object, activate a soul
circuit, sense the presence of magic.
Spiritism 【INS + WLP】Sense the presence and feelings of creatures,
put someone to sleep or embolden their heart.
The full process for casting Rituals is described on the next page. Remember that
Ritual magic should never be able to accomplish any of the following:
 Causing direct damage. The Ritual can still deal collateral damage — if you open a
chasm below your enemies' feet, they are bound to suffer some kind of harm.
When establishing collateral damage dealt by a Ritual, use the table on page 93.
 Inflicting or removing status effects.
 Causing characters to lose or gain HP, MP, IP, Fabula Points or Ultima Points.
 Replicating the mechanical benefits of an existing spell or Skill (however, narrative
effects such as teleportation or flight are okay, even if some Skills do grant them).
 Generating creatures or equipment, or granting them permanent abilities.
Aside from these, most Rituals are fair game — but the stronger the effect you seek,
the more tragic the consequences will be if your Ritual goes wrong.

RITUALS AS GROUP CHECKS
When a character attempts a Ritual, other characters can help (even if they have no
ability to perform Rituals themselves). The Magic Check will become a Group Check
(page 50), and the character who performs the Ritual will act as the leader.
REDUCING THE COST OF A RITUAL
It is easy to notice that the MP cost of Rituals can be rather high. In order to reduce
this cost, the spellcaster may provide an especially rare or powerful ingredient; doing
so will cut the MP cost in half.
 This can only be done once per Ritual, and the Game Master should determine the
nature of the ingredient — finding it should be its own adventure
 If there is no time to prepare and the Ritual is urgent, an item or ingredient the GM
deems suitable can be sacrificed to allow the Ritual to take place.
SAMPLE RITUALS
Use these examples as guidelines when adjudicating Rituals.
Summoning a great globe made of fire and using it to destroy the engine of an airship
is an Elementalism Ritual of major potency targeting a small area (80 MP, DL 13). If
this Ritual fails, you might trigger a devastating firestorm.
Sensing whether a person is hostile is a Spiritism Ritual of minor potency affecting
an individual area (20 MP, DL 7). On a failure, you might accidentally instill strong
negative emotions inside them, with unpredictable consequences.
Erecting a barrier of energy to shield a castle from an avalanche is a Ritualism Ritual
of extreme potency targeting a huge area (200 MP, DL 16). If the Ritual fails, you might
cause a burst of uncontrolled magical force and trigger a supernatural cataclysm.
Altering the flow of time to briefly restore the functions of a damaged device is an
Entropism Ritual of medium potency affecting an individual area (30 MP, DL 10). On a
failure, the mechanism and some of the nearby objects might rapidly age before your
eyes and crumble to dust.

The caster can perform the first Check to fill some sections the Clock as part of
the Objective action they used to begin the Ritual.

Once the Clock is filled, the character who initiated the Ritual may use an action
to perform step 3 of the flowchart on page 119; to do so, they will they spend
the appropriate Mind Points and perform the Magic Check for the Ritual, whose

Regardless of which fantastic world your adventures take place in, your heroes will
likely find themselves purchasing and selling items. This section covers the basics of
the economy and provides you with useful lists of items and prices.
ZENIT
The common currency of all Fabula Ultima worlds is zenit, a gold coin whose shape
and size may vary from region to region. While prices may rise and fall depending on
where you are, zenit is universally accepted.
On average, 5 z pays for a decent meal, 10 z will be enough to rent a room for the
night in town, and 100 z can fetch you a bronze shield.
EQUIPPED ITEMS AND ITEMS IN YOUR BACKPACK
As shown on the character sheet, a Player Character can equip a limited number of
items on their body:
 You have one equipment slot for your armor.
 You have a main hand equipment slot, where you can equip a one-handed weapon
or a two-handed weapon. While you have a two-handed weapon equipped here, that
weapon will also take up your off-hand slot (see below).
 You have an off-hand equipment slot, where you can equip a one-handed weapon
or a shield.
 You have one equipment slot for your accessory.
Any item you have that is not equipped goes in your backpack. There is no set limit to
how many items you can carry this way, as long as it makes sense. The Game Master
has final say on what you can and cannot carry this way.
If you ever find yourself in need of transporting large and heavy items over long
distances, consider purchasing a transport (see page 125).
It takes a few moments to find items stored inside a backpack: during a conflict, for
example, you will need to spend an action searching for them. On the other hand,
items you have equipped are readily accessible, but also more exposed to the risk of
being damaged or stolen.
An item stored in your backpack does not grant you any of its properties. If you want
it to “work”, you must equip it!
ECONOMY AND ITEMS

GAME RULES

CHAPTER
HOW TO GET NEW ITEMS
There are plenty of occasions for characters to acquire gear and equipment: villages
and towns will always have one or more stores dedicated to weapons, armor, and
useful accessories. This doesn’t mean a character can simply walk into a shop in the
middle of nowhere and expect to purchase a magical crossbow, however: while basic
weapons, armor, and shields should be available in most settlements, rare items
should only be found in unique stores, hidden within the most dangerous of ruins,
guarded by powerful monsters or offered as a reward for heroic deeds.
If you are the Game Master, see page 266 for rules and guidelines on how to create
rare items, as well as several lists of premade items.
A list of basic items can be found starting on page 130.
There are three main ways treasure and magical items can
be handled during a Fabula Ultima campaign.
When you start playing, you should discuss which of the
methods below you want to adopt; you can always change
your decision later on after a few sessions.
 Classic. The GM hands out rewards as they see fit. This is probably the most
common solution, but it puts a lot of responsibility on the GM's shoulders.
 Survey. The Game Master asks everyone about the kind of items they'd like
their characters to find or use — perhaps the ninja would like to wear an
intimidating han'nya mask (page 286), or the brawler can't wait to get her
hands on a pair of fuel knuckles (page 272). Using this method, the GM has a
useful list of items they can pick from when handing out rewards.
 Wishlist. This is an uncommon approach, but it can be interesting. Each Player
writes a list of items they would like their character to find over the course of
their career — these can be chosen from the lists of rare items in the Game
Master chapter, or designed from scratch following the guidelines presented
there. Then, whenever the group finds some kind of treasure or receives a
reward, the Players themselves can pick from those lists and narrate what the
item is — as well as why it was there.
REWARDS
124
W
SELLING ITEMS
Provided you can find someone willing to buy it, an item will sell for roughly half its
original price. This amount may be modified by the item’s quality and condition: no
one will want the rusted, mud-caked axes picked up in the old tunnels.
The Game Master always has final say on whether you are able to sell a given item and
how many zenit you can make from it; sometimes it will also be possible to barter or
carry out duties in exchange for goods.
ARTIFACTS
Player Characters will sometimes come into possession of incredibly powerful magic
items, known as artifacts (see page 288). Given their nature, artifacts should never be
purchased or sold: no amount of riches can do them justice. Entire kingdoms could go
to war for a chance to obtain them.
SERVICES AND TRANSPORTS
Prices and availability for animals, vehicles, lodging, and such may vary depending on
your game world. The following lists are meant to be a guideline for the Game Master
when establishing prices.
When it comes to transports, the list includes generic entries for mounts, cars, vessels,
airships and such. Each transport can carry a certain number of passengers and
increases the distance you can cover within a single travel day.
 Terrestrial transports can only travel on land, aquatic
transports can travel on water surfaces, submarine transports
can travel above and underwater, and flying transports can
travel the skies.
 If you purchase a vehicle hauled by animals, their cost is
included in its price.
 There is no need to keep track of animal fodder or fuel.
 Mounts acquired this way have no stats and will not fight.
If you want to ride a creature into battle, take a look at the
Wayfarer's Skill Faithful Companion (page 217).

(see above) will give you a Defense score of 9 and a Magic Defense score of 12.
 If you are not wearing any armor at all, your Defense will simply be equal to your
Dexterity die size and your Magic Defense will simply be equal to your Insight die size.
 The penalty to Initiative Group Checks caused by the armor. Martial armors usually
impose heavier penalties.
If you are not wearing any armor at all, your Initiative will suffer no penalty.
 Any special abilities the item bestows while equipped.
For a list of all the basic armors available in the game, see page 132.

SHIELDS
Shields must be equipped in a character's off-hand slot and further enhance defenses.
Each shield entry uses the format below and contains a variety of information:
SHIELD COST DEFENSE M. DEFENSE INITIATIVE
Runic Shield E 150 z +2 +2 -
No Quality.
 The shield's name, and whether it is a martial shield (E).
 The shield's cost in zenit.
 The increase to Defense and Magic Defense granted by the shield. This is in addition
to any benefits granted by the armor you may have equipped.
For a list of all the basic shields available in the game, see page 133.
Martial and non-martial armors influence a character's
Defense and Magic Defense scores in different ways.
Remember that regardless of which armor you are wearing,
shields always add to it — if you have a free slot, it's never a
bad idea to equip a shield.
 Lighter armors give you Defenses based on your current Dexterity and Insight
die sizes plus a small bonus. They are great if your Attributes are already high,
but can become less effective if you suffer status effects.
 Martial armors set your Defense score to a fixed value, regardless of your
current Dexterity die size. They offer reliable protection, but also take a heavy
toll on your Initiative.

WEAPONS
Weapons are divided into ten Categories: arcane, bow, brawling, dagger, firearm, flail,
heavy, spear, sword, and thrown.
Each weapon entry uses the format below and contains a variety of information:
WEAPON COST ACCURACY DAMAGE
Rapier E 200 z 【DEX + INS】 +1 【HR + 6】 physical
One-handed w Melee w No Quality.
 The weapon’s name, and whether it is a martial weapon (E).
 The weapon’s cost in zenit.
 The Attributes and formula used for Accuracy Checks when performing attacks with
the weapon.
 The formula used to calculate damage dealt by the weapon, and the type of damage
it deals — generally physical, but rare weapons might deal special types of damage
such as fire or dark. Remember that HR stands for High Roll — the highest of the two
dice you rolled during the Accuracy Check.
 Whether the weapon requires one hand or two hands; if you can equip the weapon
in one hand slot, you can use your other hand slot to equip another one-handed
weapon or a shield.
 Whether it is a melee weapon or a ranged weapon.
 Any special abilities the item bestows while equipped.
You do not have to keep track of ammunition for ranged weapons: once you purchase
the item, you're simply assumed to have enough on your person to fight with.
For a list of all the basic weapons available in the game, see the next page.
A NOTE ON UNARMED STRIKES
Among the various weapons available in the game, one is the unarmed strike (see
next page). These are the character's empty hands, and while they do count as onehanded
weapons, they are automatically "equipped" whenever a hand slot is empty.
Basically, an empty hand slot also counts as an unarmed strike.
Legends tell of a sword capable of striking
fear in the hearts of Dragons and Wyrms.

Much like how spellcasters gain access to Ritual magic, characters with the Tinkerer
Class (page 210) may start Projects and work on a variety of custom inventions — love
potions, walking magitech shields, or even majestic airships.
Projects work as follows:
PROJECTS
OW Describe the invention's effects, how it operates, what kind of energy it requires,
and the specific benefits it provides. The Game Master has final say on whether
a given invention is feasible in your circumstances.
1
OW
By consulting the area, potency, and uses tables (see next page), the GM
determines the invention's total cost in materials, to be paid immediately.
For inventions of medium or higher potency, the Game Master also describes a
necessary special ingredient or material. This item cannot simply be purchased
and should become the focus of one or two sessions.
3
OW
To complete the Project, you must reach an amount of progress equal to one for
every 100 zenit of material costs (minimum one progress required).
At the end of each day, the Project will advance as follows:
 +1 progress for every Player Character who worked on the Project today.
 +1 extra progress for every Player Character with one or more levels in
the Tinkerer Class who worked on the Project today.
5
OW
Once the required amount of progress is reached, the invention is created!
If you can generate more progress in a day than what is currently needed to
complete the Project, you may have it ready within a few hours instead.
6
OW If an invention is complex enough — such as a magitech motorcycle equipped
with a cannon, acting as both a vehicle and a weapon — the Game Master is free
to split the Project into two or more separate inventions, each requiring its own
individual development process.
2
OW
You may negotiate a terrible flaw with the Game Master — perhaps the invention
must be recharged at regular intervals, is unreliable, cumbersome, or extremely
loud. This flaw reduces the total cost of the Project by 25%.

situations.
Remember that the Game Master has the right to split any particularly complex or
powerful inventions into several Projects, each with its own costs and requirements.

W
DAMAGE AND PROTECTION
Sooner or later, the heroes might want to craft items that give them an edge in battle.
The Game Master always has final say on the potency of a given invention but should
use the table below as a guideline when establishing it.
Potency Damage / Healing Protection
Minor Not Available One Resistance (Consumables only)
Medium Minor Two Resistances
Major Heavy One Immunity or Two Resistances
Extreme Massive Two Immunities or Three Resistances
 Avoid creating inventions that grant Immunity to physical damage.
 If an invention has mixed effects, such as granting Resistance to a damage type and
dealing damage, it should be split into multiple Projects (see step 2 on page 134).
To determine the amount of damage or healing granted by an invention, use the
values corresponding to the current level of its inventor on the table below.
Level Minor Amount Heavy Amount Massive Amount
5+ 10 30 40
20+ 20 40 60
40+ 30 50 80

CHAPTER
USING MATERIALS TO PAY FOR PROJECTS
If you happen to gather precious materials during your adventures, you may use them
to pay for the costs of a Project. The Game Master has final say on which materials and
ingredients can help you cover the cost of a Project.
If the Game Master requests a given ingredient or material because of the invention's
potency (as described under step 3 of the flowchart on page 134), said ingredient or
material cannot also be used to pay for the Project's costs.
HIRING HELPERS
If an inventor wants to increase the daily amount of progress, or if they want to work
on multiple Projects at the same time, they may want to hire helpers.
 Each helper is a competent worker or assistant who will ask for a pay equal to half of
the Project’s total cost.
 Each helper will generate 1 additional progress at the end of each day.
The sticky core found inside Elemental Slimes can
be used to produce several forms of energy.
The rules for Projects are very flexible, but they are designed
to allow characters to create something unique and never
seen before, not to craft items that can normally be found
or purchased, such as equipment — they should be used to
provide innovative solutions to problems and obstacles.
 If the character wants to create multiple copies of an invention, each is
a separate Project. Turning inventions into easy-to-produce items will
inevitably break the game. For Tinkerers who want to customize equipment,
look at the Heroic Skill Upgrade (page 241).
 Projects require time: if the group focuses on a long Project, Villains will
certainly not sit idly.
 Interlude scenes are perfect for narrating a Project's development.
HOW TO USE PROJECTS

W
SAMPLE PROJECTS
INVENTION POTENCY AREA USE
The "Discovery" Major Large Permanent
Total Project Cost: 6000 zenit; Progress Required: 60; Flaw: None.
A large airship that can transport up to fifty people. It provides no additional firepower
or protection — armaments, barriers, and so on would all be considered separate
Projects and can be subsequently added to the airship's base chassis.
Gatling Golem Major Individual Permanent
Total Project Cost: 1500 zenit; Progress Required: 15; Flaw: Yes.
A semi-intelligent floating weapon. This golem will act after the inventor's turn
during conflict scenes, dealing minor physical damage to a single target. However,
it is extremely loud and highly experimental: enemies may spend an opportunity to
disable it until the end of the scene.
Mag Boots Medium Individual Permanent
Total Project Cost: 1000 zenit; Progress Required: 10; Flaw: None.
A pair of magnetic boots that allows the wearer to safely attach themselves to metallic
surfaces, possibly walking on walls or even ceilings.
Magitech Suit See below See below See below
Total Project Cost: 1750 zenit; Progress Required: 17; Flaw: Yes.
An advanced four-legged armor fueled by magitech energy.
 The pilot has Resistance to fire damage and physical damage.
 The pilot can use the Attack action to unleash a searing heat ray causing minor
fire damage. It is a ranged attack and requires a【 DEX + INS】 Accuracy Check.
 The pilot also suffers Vulnerability to bolt damage.
Given the complexity and power of this invention, the Game Master splits it into
two separate Projects: the armor itself and then its heat cannon, both with medium
potency, individual area, and permanent use.
The inventor added a flaw to one of the Projects (Vulnerability to bolt damage) in
order to partially reduce the cost.

INVENTION POTENCY AREA USE
Negator Spike Major Small Consumable
Total Project Cost: 600 zenit; Progress Required: 6; Flaw: Yes.
When activated and driven into the ground, this large rune-inscribed spike will
prevent all creatures on the scene (friends and foes alike, which is an important flaw)
from casting spells or performing Rituals. This effect lasts until the end of the scene
or until the negator itself is destroyed (probably a six-section Clock).
Puredust Medium Small Consumable
Total Project Cost: 400 zenit; Progress Required: 4; Flaw: None.
This magically blessed dust grants the user and all nearby allies Resistance to dark
and poison damage until the end of the scene.
Pyro Oil Medium Large Consumable
Total Project Cost: 600 zenit; Progress Required: 6; Flaw: None.
A single vial of hyper-concentrated fire elemental essence. When shattered, it
unleashes a vortex of flames and deals minor fire damage to every creature in a vast
area. Flammable items of small size might also be set on fire.
Sleep Gas Major Small Consumable
Total Project Cost: 800 zenit; Progress Required: 8; Flaw: None.
An alchemical vial containing enough gas to fill a room, putting everyone to sleep for
a few hours — they will still awaken if harmed, slapped or shaken vigorously enough,
but they will sleep through loud noises.
Underwater Helm Medium Individual Permanent
Total Project Cost: 1000 zenit; Progress Required: 10; Flaw: None.
A magical mask that allows the wearer to breathe underwater.

GROUP DYNAMICS
A SAFE PLAY ENVIRONMENT
In line with the JRPG genre that inspiration has been drawn from, Fabula Ultima’s
tones are heroic and optimistic, despite the occasional presence of tragic or darker
scenes — especially when Villains are involved. The general expectation is that scenes
will not be particularly gritty or morbidly described, even when death is involved —
but since you never know what might hurt the sensibility of the people playing, here
is a list of tools and “good practices”.
 Mutual trust and respect. This should go without saying, but respecting the people
you are playing with is key to a good experience — and the same applies to putting
your trust in them. Roleplaying games are a highly social activity, and it is perfectly
normal for people to get a bit tense and emotional during dramatic moments, but
mutual trust and respect are the main foundation for good play. Whatever happens
between characters in your story, the people at the table must be good to each other.
 The game and its fiction must not replace human interaction. If someone's behavior
bothers anyone, that issue must be solved outside the game. There’s nothing wrong
with pausing a session to get things sorted and going back to it once you’ve found an
agreement. Do not, under any circumstance, use the game as a tool for proving your
point or influencing someone's behavior.
 Lines and Veils. These terms were coined by Ron Edwards in Sex and Sorcery, and
they are practical safety tools with a history of good results. Before or during the
game, you may declare that you are drawing a line or veiling a situation or action.
When you draw a line, you are saying that you don't want this element in the game.
It won't happen, it didn't happen, and your shared story will never talk about that.
When you veil, you are saying that while the element is present, you don't want it
to be expressly depicted or brought into the spotlight. It's still a part of your world
and will influence your character's actions, but it will take place "behind the scenes".
These tools are especially useful if you’re playing with people you’ve never met before,
but keep them in mind even when you’re with old-time friends. Every single person
has something that makes them uncomfortable, sometimes to an unbearable degree
— overly detailed descriptions of violence, portrayals of unhealthy relationships, or
even something you believe is commonplace but somehow left a scar on them.
When playing the game, one of your duties is to create a safe environment — don’t
insist on asking why something made someone uncomfortable: instead, ask them how
they’d prefer this type of scene or situation to be handled from now on.
2
GAME RULES
141
W
CHAPTER
PLAYER CHARACTER AGAINST PLAYER CHARACTER
While the protagonists of Fabula Ultima are heroes, this doesn’t mean there won’t
be disagreements or hostilities between them. Situations might arise in which two or
more Player Characters are at odds: you can resolve these through mutual agreement
or by using the rules as normal.
When handling such a situation, make sure to remember the following:
 Take some time to think about what’s happening. When the goals or actions of
two or more Player Characters are at odds, don’t be too hasty about rolling dice. Just
“pause” the game and let the involved Players find an agreement on how to resolve
the situation.
Keep in mind that these rules have been written to solve conflicts between characters:
the corresponding Players are still responsible for an enjoyable game experience and
should cooperate with each other. If a disagreement arises between Players, there’s
not much this game can do: solve the issue through dialogue and go back to playing
the game once you’re on the same page again.
 Establish what is at stake and determine a resolution method. With the help of
your Game Master, Players should establish what their characters want to accomplish
(sometimes this will be enough to realize your goals aren’t in conflict). Then, you
should choose a method to resolve the contrast: Opposed Checks generally work
well for this.
Do not roll dice until you’re sure everyone understands what will happen. If you are
struggling to find an agreement, consider setting the issue aside and coming back to
it once you’ve reached a compromise. Perhaps the characters bicker and argue, but a
more urgent threat demands their attention.
 Apply the results. Once the dice hit the table, apply the outcome for what it is: don’t
try to fudge the results or avoid the consequences of your actions. In this case, it is
probably best for the Game Master to impartially describe what happens to everyone
involved.
142
W
SECRETS
It is not uncommon for a Player Character to hide secrets from their companions, be it
their past misdeeds or their burning love for an antagonist.
While it's perfectly fine for characters to have secrets, Players should instead keep
things transparent and work together to get the most out of the situation.
By telling your group "My character looks like they want to be friends with you, but
she actually hates you because of what happened in Galatea" you are empowering
everyone at the table, including yourself: now that this facet of your hero is known, it
will be possible to build upon it and create drama.
Never forget that this game relies on a collaborative storytelling effort: disclosing
your character's secrets means giving your fellow Players a chance to make things
interesting — do not think of it as "letting your guard down".
LEAVING THE GROUP
There might come a moment when you feel like your character has been fully
explored; they have faced their fears, achieved their goals, and found who or what
they were looking for, with the campaign not yet reaching its end.
When this happens, you are free to announce that your character will be leaving the
group — you should do so between sessions and also come up with a replacement
character. Then, at the beginning of the following session, describe your character's
epilogue and agree on how and why your new character joins the group.
 If you want to temporarily retire a character but retain the ability to bring them back
later on during the campaign, you should discuss it with the rest of your group.
 Whenever a new character (or a previously retired character) joins the group, they
should have the same level and XP as the character they are replacing. If the character
is a returning character, the Player should briefly describe what they did while away
from the rest of the group.
 Regardless of how many Player Characters are owned by a Player, that Player may
only control a single PC at once. The Game Master has final say on when you can
"switch characters" — generally between sessions or after resting in town.
Needless to say, you can only switch to a different character if that character is
somewhere nearby or has the means to reach the rest of the group.

GAME RULES
143

CHAPTER
ABSENT PLAYERS
We all have busy lives, and sometimes this means one or more people will be unable
to take part in a session.
When this happens, the simplest option is often to reschedule the session for a
different date. Just pick another day to meet — in the meantime, you can play another
game with whoever is present!
On the other hand, if you are determined to run a session even if one or more
participants are absent — and you should do this only if whoever's missing is okay
with it — each absent Player chooses one of the following for their character:
 I'll join you later. Your character will remain in town (or somewhere safe) and carry
on some kind of task. This is a good chance to gather information, purchase items, and
work on Projects. Discuss what your character does with the Game Master.
Your character will join the rest of the group at the beginning of the next session;
describe how you got there.
 I'll be in your care. For this session, your character will be controlled by the rest of
the group as a whole (excluding the Game Master).
While controlled by the group, your character cannot spend Fabula Points and will
automatically surrender if reduced to 0 Hit Points. The Game Master should be
cautious when applying consequences to characters belonging to absent Players, and
everyone else should do their best to protect them.
Regardless of which option you choose for your character, the following apply:
 Your character will not gain Fabula Points while absent from a session.
 Your character will gain Experience Points as normal at the end of the session.
This might cause your character to level up (see page 226).
As soon as you take part in a session again, you will be able to gain and spend Fabula
Points as normal.
The nature of this world is not one of absolutes.

CHAPTER
PRESS START
This chapter contains the rules for starting your Fabula Ultima game.
Within the following pages you will discover how to create your game world, give
your group a core theme, build your very own characters, and finally, begin play with
a prologue.
SESSION ZERO
While reading this chapter on your own is an excellent idea, the steps require everyone
in your group to be present. This meeting, also known as session zero, is meant to
establish the basics of the setting in which your adventures will take place, along with
the themes you want to explore and the heroes you will portray.
 For the Game Master, this is a great time to learn about the Player Characters and
start thinking about interesting scenarios, locations, and antagonists. Make sure to
ask lots of questions and take plenty of notes.
 For the Players, this is where you cooperate with everyone else to create your very
own world and characters. It is a chance to inject it with your own fantasy ideas, be it
a particular aesthetic, a magical technology, or a terrifying danger.
Needless to say, there will be many occasions to leave your mark on the world you will
create; however, think of this moment as the root of your play experience, from which
everything else will grow, evolve, and blossom.
WAIT, I’VE CHANGED MY MIND!
The sections of this chapter are presented in a specific order, but you are free to go
back to any step and revise the choices whenever you feel the need.
For instance, when creating your character, you might come up with an idea for a cool
location and mark it on the world map. Or you could end up with a band of heroes that
suits a different type of group from the one you had previously selected.
You are building the foundations of your campaign... take your time!
146
W
Now that you've gathered together, there are a few things to discuss before you begin
creating your world and characters. For each topic, read the questions and discuss your
choices as a group.
COMMITMENT AND EXPECTATIONS
The first thing you should discuss is the amount of time and effort everyone will be
able to dedicate to the game. This will help set expectations and avoid issues later
on during play.
 Will you play for a set amount of sessions, or are you simply going to start playing and
see where the story leads you?
 How often will you play? Weekly, monthly, twice per month?
 The game is designed around sessions of approximately four hours, but how long do
you expect your sessions to be? If your sessions are shorter or longer, remember to
check for Experience Points approximately every four hours (see page 226).
 If there are missing Players, will you reschedule the session, or will you play
nonetheless? Which solution will you adopt for the missing Players' characters?
See page 143 for suggestions.
TONE AND THEMES
This is a game with a relatively broad scope: depending on the kind of world and
characters you create, the campaign's tone and themes can vary quite a bit. Because
this is a shared storytelling experience, you need to be on the same page or at least
lay a solid foundation — you can always discuss changes later.
 What kind of tone do you expect during the narration? Would you prefer a heavily
dramatic tale dealing with complex situations and emotions, or would you rather tell
a fantastical story where good and evil are easily told apart?
 Are there any themes you strongly wish to explore during play?
 Will the heroes be best friends from the start, or are you okay with moments of crisis
and disagreements within the party? How will you resolve these contrasts?
See page 141 for suggestions.
 When describing scenes and actions, are you okay with over-the-top anime
descriptions or would you prefer a heroic but more fable-like approach?

CHAPTER
RULES AND CHALLENGE
Much like tone and themes, this game allows you to customize its rules and play it
with a varying degree of mechanical challenge and optimization.
 Are you adopting any of the optional rules presented in the book? Pay special
attention to optional rules for conflicts (page 82) and advancement (page 230).
 How "hardcore" do you expect your game experience to be? Are you aiming for
mechanical optimization with your characters? Do you expect the Game Master to
design extremely challenging adversaries? Or are you here for a relaxing experience
that takes minimal focus?
SAFETY
Roleplaying games tend to get us emotionally and personally involved. It's their beauty,
but it also leaves us vulnerable. Make sure to discuss whatever descriptions, situations,
scenes, and story elements might make you uncomfortable. Everyone should indicate
any lines and veils (page 140) that they want to apply during sessions; it can be a
good idea to handle this anonymously to preserve the privacy of the participants.
In particular, you should make sure to discuss:
 The depiction of violence. By default, Fabula Ultima expects little elements of gore
and blood: much like in classic JRPGs, death is portrayed as a character kneeling or
vanishing in a cloud of spiritual particles — but still talk about the kind of scenes and
descriptions people are okay with.
 The nature of evil. Story elements such as mind control, the persecution of a minority,
or violent imperialism are all common tropes in tabletop games, but for some, they
are very real and tangible threats. Strive to make sure the game is a safe space.
 Romances, relationships, and sexuality. These elements are another trope of JRPG
stories, which often feature romances between main characters. Discuss if people are
comfortable with this and exactly to what degree.
As you play the game, you will probably reconsider some of your previous decisions.
When this happens, talk about it with the group and find a new agreement.
Remember: you win roleplaying games by creating a memorable story and having
a great time together!
148

WORLD CREATION
Your first step is the shared creation of the game world (also known as a “setting”) in
which your characters’ adventures will take place. This process involves both the Game
Master and the Players and provides everyone with a strong foundation for heroes,
antagonists, creatures, and events.
You will need the world sheet and the map sheet.
The flowchart on the next page describes the world creation process. If you want, give
your setting a name: even something as simple as Earth, Gaia or The Planet will work
fine... we do the same in our real world, after all!
As explained on page 14, all Fabula Ultima worlds share some core elements — the
Eight Pillars. When creating your setting, keep those elements in mind! Pay special
attention to the following:
 Souls. Everything living and unliving is connected by the stream of souls. Some
worlds might feature machinery fueled by soul energy, while in other settings,
spiritual corruption might give birth to monstrous creatures.
Discuss what people generally know about souls in your world.
 Conflicts and struggles. The cultures populating your world haven’t been able to
unite themselves under a single banner. Their motives can range from centuries-old
rivalries, ideological or religious strife, misunderstandings, perhaps even the cruelties
of one nation against the other. Drawing inspiration from the real world can be a
good idea, as it is (unfortunately) rife with turmoil and injustice.
 A fantastical, diverse world. When creating your setting, you shouldn’t concern
yourself with realism, verisimilitude, or historical accuracy. A city-state inspired by
ancient Greece might be bordering with a flying fortress, guarded by warriors clad
in Song Dynasty-style armor and practicing a form of alchemy similar to that of the
Italian Renaissance.
What really matters is for each location's appearance to reflect the themes and
emotions it will embody within your story.
The flowchart presents the world creation steps in a more intuitive order, but you’re
always free to go back and make adjustments when needed.
The most important part is that everyone can share ideas freely. Whenever a step
states that “each person should contribute an element”, that doesn’t mean they must
come up with it entirely on their own: as with any other aspect of this game, dialogue
and communication are key to a good experience!

Create the major kingdoms and nations of your world, mark their borders on
the map and discuss their relations: mutual trust, strained alliances, or open
conflict? Each person at the table should contribute at least one kingdom or
nation during this step, providing some details about their customs, beliefs,
industry, denizens, and creatures.
4
W Choose a shape for your world: is it round, flat, or are the regions floating amidst
the clouds? Could it be donut-shaped, in typical JRPG fashion?
You might even decide that the shape of your world is yet to be discovered!
1
W Grab a map sheet that fits your concept (or draw a custom map; just make sure
to leave plenty of blank space for settlements and locations). Your world can
span more than one sheet, of course — but let’s keep things simple for now.
Remember to establish the length of a travel day on the map (see page 106).
2
W What is the role of magic and technology in your setting? Are you living in an
age of industrial development, or is it more Renaissance-like?
Is magic seen as a form of science, or mostly as a great mystery?
3
W Discuss the major historical events that shaped your world into what it is.
Each person at the table should contribute at least one important event that
dramatically altered the history of your setting.
5
W What are the great enigmas and mysteries of the world? The questions left
unanswered, and the truths that are now indistinguishable from legend?
Each person at the table should contribute at least one mystery of the world that
they want to explore over the course of the group’s adventures.
6
W
What terrible threats cast a shadow over your world? Environmental disasters,
furious deities, power-hungry empires, or perhaps even clouds of corrupting
miasma that are enveloping and consuming the land?
Each person at the table should contribute a threat, preferably something that is
endangering the future of entire nations. The Game Master will base a majority
of their villains and antagonists on these worldwide threats.

GROUP CREATION
Unlike the creation process for your game world, group creation isn’t particularly
structured — in fact, it’s mostly about establishing the fundamental themes of your
early adventures. When you select a group type, you are saying “Hey, this is how we
want to explore the world we just created — we’d really like our shared story to mostly
focus on these aspects of it.”
Additionally, your choice of group will inform the kind of heroes you will make during
the next step of session zero. Don’t take it as a restriction: instead, see it as a useful
reference to go back to whenever you are unsure about your character concepts.
You can even give your group a name — such as the Brotherhood of the Griffin or the
Queenshields.
If you are the Game Master, treat this step as a precious opportunity to learn what kind
of situations, stories, and antagonists everyone is excited about!
BROUGHT TOGETHER BY FATE
You find yourselves working together because of the circumstances. Despite this being
a common trope in classic fantasy tales, it is actually the most difficult to pull off since
your group will lack a precise goal: you must work with each other during play to build
a web of relationships (Bonds become incredibly important).
If you choose this premise, it may be a good idea to switch to a different type of group
once your characters have developed a common goal.
 What emotional or familial connections exist between your characters?
 Have your characters met in the past? Are there any tensions or rivalries?
 What do you have in common? Beliefs, enemies, past experiences?
GUARDIANS
One of the Player Characters is a Chosen One, a person tasked with a mission that
could change the very fate of the world. Everyone else in your group has sworn, by duty
or by choice, to protect the Chosen One during their travels.
 What bonds, ties or rivalries exist between each guardian and the Chosen One?
 What is your mission? Who gave it to you? Do the authorities approve of it?
 Why does the Chosen One need protection? Who or what threatens their mission?

HEROES OF THE RESISTANCE
You are the last line of defense against a terrible power, a darkness that threatens to
envelop the known world — such as a power-hungry kingdom or an oppressive empire.
The fate of many lies within your hands.
 Why is this daunting task up to you? Have you fought against this enemy before?
 Which factions helped you, and which ones betrayed or opposed you?
 Who are the most infamous among the enemy leaders and followers?
REVOLUTIONARIES
You form a small force that fights tooth and nail against a dominant power: it might be
a tyrannical government, a military occupation, or even a ruthless industrial company.
Society and security forces probably consider you criminals or terrorists.
 What is the price your character paid for their insubordination?
 Which factions promised you their help? Which factions might oppose you?
 What are your enemies’ crimes, and why is no one else opposing them?
SEEKERS
You are desperately searching for someone or something — a powerful witch, an
ancient relic, a legendary location, or even a long-lost technological marvel. What you
seek is the world’s last hope, or at least, you think it is.
 What is it you are trying to prevent or remedy? What are you looking for?
 What do you know of your mission? Who or what gave you this information?
 Who doesn't want you to find what you seek?
 What prompted each of you to join this mission?

CHARACTER CREATION
Grab some blank character sheets because it is time to create Player Characters!
While this might look like something you can do on your own, it is actually better
for all participants (Game Master included) to go through this step together: while
each hero belongs to the person controlling them, these characters are destined to be
adventuring together, which means they should have some “chemistry” from the very
beginning!
Character Creation is presented as a series of steps, similarly to World Creation; you
are not, however, bound to take these steps in this exact order. You can go back and
modify your choices anytime during the process.
Characters are normally created at level 5; see page 229 for higher-level PCs.

CHAPTER
CREATE YOUR IDENTITY
This is your first step, and to say it will influence each and every following choice
would be an understatement. Your character’s Identity is a short sentence that quickly
summarizes how they currently see themselves.
When you create your Identity, keep an eye on the list of available Classes (see page
160) and make sure there is a combination of two or three Classes that fits your
Identity. If you really can’t find what you need, try adjusting your Identity and adapting
it to fit one of the available combinations.
Here are a few examples of good identities:
 Royal Knight.  Queen of the Desert Thieves.
 Battle Priestess of the Old Faith.  Warrior Princess of the Moon People.
 Elderly Amnesiac Sorcerer.  Former Imperial Strategist.
 Freedom-fighting Brawler.  Magitech Scientist.
 Tormented Veteran.  One-eyed Samurai.
Keep in mind that you can invoke your Identity to give yourself an edge when making
Checks: pick something that will prove useful in play.
Over the course of your adventures, you will be able to change your Identity: a Captain
of the Crimson Reapers might redeem herself and change her Identity to that of a
Knight of the White Flame, for instance. This is a good thing: it means your character
has grown into someone different!
Example: Robert is creating his first character.
Previously, he and the rest of her group worked on their game world: a land in early
industrial development, where magic is tied to family bloodlines.
They are going to be heroes of the resistance, fighting against a technological empire
that seeks to imprison anyone who can channel magic. Robert’s character, Camilla, is
going to be the (supposedly) last surviving member of Platea's royal dynasty.
Contrary to her older brothers and sisters, Camilla never developed any magical
ability: however, she has been trained as a knight and diplomat.
Camilla's Identity is going to be “The Last Princess of Platea”.
While talking with the rest of her group, Robert points out that he’s open to Camilla
discovering her “latent magical powers” over the course of the game.

CHOOSE OR CREATE YOUR THEME
Each Player Character in Fabula Ultima is defined by a primary Theme, a strong ideal
or emotion driving their actions and choices. If you had to build an entire scene around
your character, their Theme would be its dominant focus.
If this is your first character, it is strongly suggested that you pick your Theme from the
list below. Otherwise, you can create something new and unique: discuss this choice
with the rest of your group and make sure it creates interesting situations.
When you choose a Theme, describe how it applies to your character — what is their
Ambition? What Duty are they bound by? Who will be the target of their Vengeance?
Suggested Themes
Ambition You strive to prove your worth to yourself and/or others.
Anger You are a ticking bomb, always on the brink of rage.
Belonging You are afraid of being alone, forgotten or abandoned.
Doubt You need to find the answer to a burning question.
Duty You live to fulfill a promise you made or obey an order you received.
Guilt You wish to atone for your past mistakes.
Hope You seek a better world for yourself and/or others.
Justice You always side with the weak and defenseless.
Mercy You wish to help others, regardless of their past misdeeds.
Vengeance You seek to bring retribution upon someone or something.
Just like with your Identity, pick something that will prove useful in play, and remember
that you will be able to change your Theme over the course of the game.
Vengeance could be a fitting Theme for Camilla, but Robert doesn’t want her to be
consumed by bitterness and a grudge. The young hero's true goal is to create a land
where her people can live in accordance with their customs and traditions, which the
Empire has outlawed: therefore, Camilla's Theme will be Hope.

CHAPTER CHOOSE OR CREATE YOUR ORIGIN
All heroes come from somewhere: this is their Origin. It might be a humble village, a
great city, or even something more fantastical such as a palace in the depths of the
ocean, the Moon’s surface, or an entirely different solar system.
You may pick a location that is already present on the map sheet or create a new one.
Just like your Identity and Theme, your Origin may be invoked to reroll one or both
dice during a Check. However, you will normally be unable to change your Origin in
play — unless you suddenly discover you come from an entirely different place and
your memories are fake, which is a fantasy trope as well.
Robert came up with the concept for Platea while creating Camilla; because of this,
Platea must be added to the map sheet. Robert chooses an area in the South and
describes Platea as a once-peaceful and bright citadel atop a cliff overseeing a vast
lake. Right now, the city has been seized by the Empire.
In Fabula Ultima, your character's species and heritage
has no mechanical impact unless you want it to — perhaps
their Identity is that of a Fallen Elven Prince, or some of
their Class Skills can be explained as a consequence of their
unique anatomy or bloodline.

CHOOSE TWO TO THREE STARTING CLASSES
Your character begins play at level 5. This means you will have five levels to distribute
among any of the fifteen available Classes. Your character must have at least two
Classes when they begin play, and no more than three.
Entries describing each Class can be found starting on page 176, but the table below
offers a quick summary of their individual focus.
Classes
Arcanist Summon magical avatars of ancient, godlike entities.
Chimerist Learn spells from creatures and speak with beasts.
Darkblade
Unleash dark attacks and draw power from Bonds.
 Allows you to equip martial melee weapons and armors.
Elementalist Wield the destructive power of the elements.
Entropist Channel the dark energy of the Cosmos.
Fury
Provoke enemies and hit harder when damaged.
 Allows you to equip martial melee weapons and armors.
Guardian
Protect your allies and fight clad in heavy armor.
 Allows you to equip martial armor and shields.
Loremaster Be a master of knowledge and support your allies.
Orator Use your words to gain allies and influence conflicts.
Rogue Seize opportunities and steal unique items from enemies.
Sharpshooter
Excel at ranged combat and negate ranged attacks.
 Allows you to equip martial ranged weapons and shields.
Spiritist Support your allies with magic and cast light spells.
Tinkerer Craft inventions and use Inventory Points in new ways.
Wayfarer Be a master explorer and join forces with a loyal companion.
Weaponmaster

CHAPTER
Every Class provides the following information:
 A short description of the Class, covering its general role and premise.
 A list of questions that will help you define the goals, past experiences, and behavior
of your character. You don’t have to answer all of them straight away — in fact, it's
much better to let these elements emerge during play, through your character’s
actions and choices. You also can decide to ignore some of these questions if your
character concept isn't strongly tied to that particular Class.
 A list of free benefits that your character will gain simply by acquiring the Class,
such as the ability to equip martial equipment or a slight increase to Hit Points, Mind
Points or Inventory Points. If two or more of your Classes give you the same free
benefits, they will stack!
 A set of five Class Skills that are unique to the Class in question. Whenever you invest
a level in a Class, you acquire one of its Skills; any Skills marked with a (ç) can be
acquired multiple times, usually making them stronger or more flexible. The number
following the (ç) symbol tells you the maximum number of times that Skill can be
acquired — for instance, a (ç5) Skill can be taken up to five times.
When the text of a Skill mentions【 SL】, that is the Skill Level, which is to say how
many times you have acquired that Skill.
When choosing Classes, keep in mind these simply represent your current abilities —
they will not impact your character's role in the narrative unless you want them to, and
you may steer your character in entirely different directions later on.
For instance, a knight might have invested levels in Elementalist to learn a few
combat spells, without necessarily being a student of elemental magic.
If you are short on time or ideas, feel free to take a look at the Classic Characters
starting on page 172: these level 5 archetypes will prove solid in play.
Robert is intrigued by the Loremaster and Orator Classes but also realizes Camilla
trained with some of the best fighters in the land, which means Weaponmaster would
be another fitting choice.
In the end, he decides to invest two levels in Orator (acquiring Encourage and
Unexpected Ally), then three levels in Weaponmaster (acquiring Bone Crusher twice
and then the powerful Counterattack).

DETERMINE THE BASE DIE SIZE OF YOUR ATTRIBUTES
Each of a Player Character’s main Attributes (Dexterity, Insight, Might, and Willpower)
is represented by a die size, from a minimum of d6 to a maximum of d12.
Bigger die sizes indicate a more trained Attribute or a stronger natural talent.
 Dexterity measures precision, coordination, finesse and reflexes.
 Insight represents observation, understanding and reasoning.
 Might is a measure of strength, resilience and physical fortitude.
 Willpower represents determination, charisma and the ability to influence others.
Choose one of the following profiles for your hero, then distribute the corresponding
die sizes among their four Attributes (on your character sheet, these should be written
in the “base size” column).
 Jack of All Trades: d8, d8, d8, d8
 Average: d10, d8, d8, d6
 Specialized: d10, d10, d6, d6
Camilla is very insightful (Insight d10), fairly agile and determined (Dexterity d8 and
Willpower d8), but not particularly imposing (Might d6).
When allocating Attribute dice, you should take into account your choices of Classes
and Skills!

CHAPTER
CALCULATE YOUR HIT POINTS AND MIND POINTS
Your maximum Hit Points and Mind Points are calculated as follows:
 Your maximum Hit Points are equal to your total character level + five times your
character’s base Might die size.
 Your Crisis score is equal to half your maximum Hit Points, rounded down.
Your maximum Mind Points are equal to your total character level + five times your
character’s base Willpower die size.
Your character begins the game with full Hit Points and Mind Points.
These values may be further modified by your character’s choices of Class, Skills and
equipment.
Note that while some game elements might temporarily alter the die size of your
Attributes, this will never increase or decrease your Hit Points and Mind Points.
Camilla has 40 maximum Hit Points (level 5 + five times her Might of 6 + an additional
5 Hit Points granted by the Weaponmaster Class) and 50 maximum Mind Points
(level 5 + five times her Willpower of 8 + an additional 5 Mind Points granted by the
Orator Class).
Camilla's Crisis score is 20.
CALCULATE YOUR INVENTORY POINTS
Your maximum Inventory Points are calculated as follows:
 Your maximum Inventory Points are equal to 6.
Your character begins the game with full Inventory Points.
Note that this number may be further modified by your character’s choices of Class,
Skills and equipment.
Since neither Orator nor Weaponmaster increase maximum Inventory Points, Camilla
has 6 maximum Inventory Points.
164
W
CALCULATE YOUR DEFENSE, MAGIC DEFENSE AND INITIATIVE
Your Defense and Magic Defense scores are calculated as follows:
 Your Defense is equal to your current Dexterity die size.
 Your Magic Defense is equal to your current Insight die size.
 Your Initiative modifier is equal to 0.
Your defenses will be further influenced by the armor and shields you are wearing;
your Initiative modifier will also be influenced by your choice of armor.
Note that some game elements might temporarily alter your Attribute die sizes, which
will affect your Defense and Magic Defense (since these are based on the current
Attribute die size, not your base Attribute die size).
Camilla has a Defense score of 8, a Magic Defense score of 10 and no Initiative
modifier. Later on, her equipment choices will modify these numbers.
PURCHASE STARTING EQUIPMENT
You get a total budget of 500 zenit to purchase equipment with. By default, you can
only purchase basic weapons and basic armor and shields; these items are listed on
the next four pages for easy reference. If you want to purchase rare items (page 266)
or transports (page 125), discuss it with the rest of your group.
To purchase a martial (E) item, you must first be able to equip it — a benefit granted
by specific Classes.
 Darkblade allows you to equip martial melee weapons and martial armor.
 Fury allows you to equip martial melee weapons and martial armor.
 Guardian allows you to equip martial armor and martial shields.
 Sharpshooter allows you to equip martial ranged weapons and martial shields.
 Weaponmaster allows you to equip martial melee weapons and martial shields.
Write any items you purchase on your sheet and take note of their effects; remember
that ranged weapons do not require you to track ammunition.

CHAPTER
The Weaponmaster Class allows Camilla to equip martial melee weapons and shields.
Robert spends 200 zenit on a rapier (which relies on Camilla's Dexterity and Insight),
150 zenit on a runic shield (a +2 bonus to both defenses is very good!) and another
100 zenit on a travel garb.
Robert writes all these items on Camilla's sheet, noting how her armor and shield
increase Defense and Magic Defense by three points (Defense 11 and Magic Defense
13) but also give her an Initiative modifier of -1.
Needless to say, you are free to alter the name of any item that doesn't fit your
character's concept — for instance, your bronze sword might become a scimitar or
your silk vest might become a kimono.
If none of the basic weapon options fit your character concept and your group is okay
with it, you may use the rules for creating rare weapons found on page 268. However,
remember that by default, starting weapons don't have any Quality and always deal
physical damage. You may ignore one or both limitations as long as the rest of your
group agrees on it (and you have enough zenit to afford the improvements).
ROLL FOR INITIAL SAVINGS
Your character begins play with an amount of zenit equal to 2d6 × 10 (for instance,
rolling an 8 on the dice means you begin with 80 zenit).
Any left-over zenit from the previous step is added to these initial savings!
Robert rolls 2d6 × 10 and gets 60 zenit, which are added to the 50 zenit left from the
previous step — for a total of 110 zenit in initial savings.

The weapons, armors, and shields you choose during
character creation will accompany you for quite a few
levels, so make sure they work well with the way you built
your character.
Here are some useful tips:
 Choose a main weapon that complements your choice of Attributes. Ideally,
you want to be able to roll at least 1d10 + 1d8 for Accuracy. More accurate
weapons, such as swords and daggers, can compensate for low Attributes.
 Even if your character tends to rely on spells, purchase a weapon for them to
use when low on Mind Points — a dagger, a staff, or a tome.
 While lighter armors increase your Defense score (which would otherwise be
equal to your Dexterity size), martial (E) armors replace that score with a
fixed value.
This can make quite the difference: even if you have a low Dexterity or suffer
a status effect, your Defense score will not be affected.
The bonus to Defenses granted by shields still applies, of course: a character
with d8 Dexterity wearing a brigandine and wielding a bronze shield will
have a Defense score of 12, for instance.

NAME AND FINISHING TOUCHES
Give your character a name, note their pronoun(s), and briefly describe what they look
like to the rest of the group!
It may seem counterintuitive for this step to be the last one, but there’s a good reason:
it’s easier to choose a name once you have a good grasp of your character's appearance
and abilities.
On the next page, you can find a chart with a variety of
names that work particularly well for a Fabula Ultima
game; however, if your world is inspired by specific
folklore or mythology, you should research fitting
naming conventions and come up with something
more appropriate!
Now that Camilla is ready, Robert describes her
to the rest of the group: she has greyish
brown hair and deep blue eyes, and her
demeanor showcases her strong will —
it's almost impossible to be around her
and not feel inspired!
Her clothes are light and comfortable,
perfect for traveling, and she fights with
an elegant rapier and a small elbow shield
inscribed with a circle of defensive runes.

ARCANIST SKILLS
ARCANE CIRCLE (ç4)
After you willingly dismiss an Arcanum on your turn during a conflict (see next page), if
that Arcanum had not been summoned during this same turn and you have an arcane
weapon equipped, you may immediately perform the Spell action for free. The spell
you cast this way must have a total Mind Point cost of【 SL × 5】 or lower (you must
still pay the spell's MP cost).
ARCANE REGENERATION (ç2)
When you summon an Arcanum, you immediately recove【r SL × 5】 Hit Points.
BIND AND SUMMON
You may bind Arcana to your soul and summon them later. The Game Master will
tell you the details of each binding process when you first encounter the Arcanum in
question.
You may use an action and spend 40 Mind Points to summon an Arcanum you have
bound: the details of this process are explained on the next page.
If you take this Skill at character creation, you begin play with one Arcanum of your
choice already bound to you, chosen from the list on the next pages. Other than that,
you may only obtain new Arcana through exploration and story progression.
EMERGENCY ARCANUM (ç6)
As long as you are in Crisis, the cost for summoning your Arcana is reduced by【 SL ×
5】 Mind Points.
RITUAL ARCANISM
You may perform Rituals of the Arcanism discipline, as long as their effects fall within
the domains of one or more Arcana you have bound (see next pages).
Arcanism Rituals use【 WLP + WLP】 for the Magic Check.
 Where do your powers come from? Are they a gift from your bloodline?
 Have you ever communicated with an Arcanum, or are they silent and distant?
 Do people see you as mysterious, powerful, or otherworldly?
 Are there many practicing your art, or are you the exception?

THE ARCANA
MERGING WITH AN ARCANUM
When you summon an Arcanum, you gain its merge benefits; those benefits last until
the Arcanum is dismissed (see below).
You cannot summon an Arcanum while already merged with one; you must first
dismiss the current Arcanum.
DISMISSING AN ARCANUM
An Arcanum can be dismissed in several ways:
 Once the current scene ends, all Arcana are automatically dismissed.
 If you die or fall unconscious while merged with an Arcanum, they are dismissed.
 If you leave the scene while merged with an Arcanum, they are dismissed.
 You may willingly dismiss your Arcanum: this doesn't require an action, but during a
conflict it can only be done on your turn, before or after an action.
DISMISS EFFECTS
Most Arcana have a powerful dismiss effect, which may only be activated when you
willingly dismiss the Arcanum as described above — if the Arcanum is dismissed for
any other reason, the dismiss effect cannot be triggered.
If the dismiss effect of an Arcanum deals damage, it will deal 10 extra damage if you
are level 20 or higher, or 20 extra damage if you are level 40 or higher.
You are also free to ignore the dismiss effect if you don't want to use it.
DOMAINS
Each Arcanum is associated with a few key concepts or domains. The Game Master
should use these to establish the trials needed to bind the Arcanum, and to adjudicate
Rituals performed through the Ritual Arcanism Skill.
If you create new Arcana for your world, make sure to associate them with domains
that allow for interesting Rituals.

Any fire damage you deal ignores Resistances.
When you dismiss this Arcanum, choose Forge or Inferno:
Forge. You create a basic armor, shield or weapon of your choice (see pages 130
to 133). If you select this option again, the previously created item vanishes. If you
create a weapon this way, it deals fire damage instead of physical.
Inferno. Choose any number of creatures you can see: each of them suffers 30 fire
damage. This damage ignores Resistances.

You are able to read, write, speak and understand all languages.
You treat your Insight as if it were one die size higher (up to a maximum of d12).
Oracle. You ask the Game Master a single question. The Game Master must answer
truthfully, describing the vision shown to you by the Grimoire.
Once used, this dismiss effect will not be available until the next dawn. Furthermore,
the same question may never be asked more than once. The Game Master has final
say on which questions are too similar to be asked again.
ARCANUM OF THE OAK
Domains: earth, plants, poison.
You have Resistance to earth and poison damage and are immune to poisoned.
Whenever you recover Hit Points, you recover 5 extra Hit Points.
Blossom. Choose any number of creatures you can see (you may also choose
yourself): each of them recovers from the poisoned status effect and recovers 40 Hit
Points. This amount increases to 50 Hit Points if you are level 20 or higher, or to 60
Hit Points if you are level 40 or higher.
ARCANUM OF THE SKY
Domains: fog, rain, storms.
You have Resistance to air and bolt damage.
You may use an action to accurately predict weather conditions for the next day

conditions will be.

Your attacks deal 5 extra damage, and all damage dealt by your attacks is treated as
having no type (thus being unaffected by damage Affinities). Damage dealt by your
attacks cannot gain a type as long as you are merged with this Arcanum.
When you perform an attack, you may have that attack gain the multi (any number
of targets) property. If you do, this Arcanum will be automatically dismissed after the
attack is resolved (this is not considered a willing dismiss).
ARCANUM OF THE TOWER
Domains: judgment, protection, sacrifice.
When you summon this Arcanum, choose a damage type: air, bolt, dark, earth, fire,
or ice. Until this Arcanum is dismissed, each of your allies present on the scene has
Resistance to the chosen damage type (you do not gain this Resistance).
Judgment. Choose any number of creatures you can see: each of them suffers 30
light damage. This damage ignores Resistances.
ARCANUM OF THE WHEEL
Domains: destiny, speed, time.
You are immune to slow.
You gain a +1 bonus to your Defense.

ends, if the target would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, they are instead left standing with
exactly 1 Hit Point. Once that happens, this spell ends.
Reinforce 5 × T Up to three creatures Scene
You protect the targets from attacks that would corrupt their body and spirit. Choose
dazed, enraged, poisoned, shaken, slow, or weak. Until this spell ends, each target
becomes immune to the chosen status effect.
Soul Weapon 10 One equipped weapon Scene
You imbue a weapon with the cleansing energy of your spirit. Until this spell ends,
all damage dealt by the weapon becomes of the light type. If you have that weapon
equipped while you cast this spell, you may perform a free attack with it as part of
the same action.
This spell can only be cast on a weapon equipped by a willing creature.
Torpor r 5 × T Up to three creatures Instantaneous
You smother the soul energy coursing through the bodies of your foes, hindering their
movements. Choose slow or weak: you inflict the chosen status effect on each target
hit by this spell.
c Spells marked with r are offensive spells and require Magic Checks!

TINKERER
I like to think that what
we have today was not
a gift from the Gods.
Tinkerers possess exceptional
ingenuity and are known for
their eccentric and marvelous
inventions. They travel the
world in an endless search
for lost theories and ancient
machinery, eyes glimmering
whenever they witness the
wonders of architecture and
engineering.
In a way, Tinkerers could be
seen as the ultimate dreamers
and rebels, challenging the
very rules of nature and
society in their pursuit of a
better future.

ALCHEMY
Also: Chemistry, Bombs, Mutations.
You may perform the Inventory action to rapidly craft a potion with powerful but
somewhat unpredictable effects. When you do so, choose one type of mix among
those you have unlocked (basic, advanced or superior) and spend the appropriate
amount of Inventory Points.
MIX IP COST DESCRIPTION
Basic 3 Roll two d20s and assign one to target and one to effect.
Advanced 4 Roll three d20s and assign one to target and one to effect.
Superior 5 Roll four d20s and assign one to target and one to effect.
When you create a mix, roll the amount of twenty-sided dice indicated by that mix,
then assign one of those rolls to the target table (below) and one to the effect table
(on the right). Discard all remaining dice, then describe the effects of the mix!
Example: You spend 5 Inventory Points for a superior mix and roll four twenty-sided
dice. You roll 3, 14, 9 and 4. You might assign 14 to target and 9 to effect to grant
yourself and all allies Resistance to air and fire; or you could go on the offensive and
assign 9 to target and 4 to effect to deal bolt damage to a single enemy; or even
assign 9 to target and 14 to effect to inflict four status effects on that foe!
Whatever your choice, the two dice you don't assign will be discarded.
The two effects marked with "Any" on the effect table are always available and can be
chosen if none of the available effects appeal to you.

d MAGITECH OVERRIDE (Basic)
You may use an action and spend 10 Mind Points to perform an Opposed【 INS + INS】
Check against a nearby soldier-rank construct you can see (the Game Master must
tell you who is a valid target). If you succeed, you gain control of the creature until
the end of the scene (the Game Master gives you its profile). You may only control one
construct at any given time, but may set it free whenever you want; the construct
is also set free as soon as it is harmed by you or by one of your allies. Once free, the
construct is again in control of its actions and might turn against you.
d MAGICANNON (Advanced)
You may perform the Inventory action and spend 3 Inventory Points to create a firearm
weapon known as a magicannon (see below). The magicannon will crumble to pieces
as soon as you create a new magicannon. When you create a magicannon, choose the
type of damage it deals (air, bolt, earth, fire, ice, or physical).
WEAPON ACCURACY DAMAGE
Magicannon 【DEX + INS】 +1 【HR + 10】

d MAGISPHERES (Superior)
You develop three magisphere prototypes; each of them can replicate a spell chosen
from the following lists: Elementalist, Entropist and Spiritist. The spells you choose
may come from the same list or different lists.
You also develop two more prototypes upon reaching level 20, and another two upon
reaching level 40 (the same applies if you already reached those levels).
You may perform the Inventory action and spend 2 Inventory Points to create a

PROLOGUES
Now that you have built your world together, chosen the focus of your group and
created a cast of heroes, it is time for you to begin play!
The early part of your first session will be dedicated to a prologue — a few scenes
that introduce the protagonists and tells us where their story begins. It is also a great
moment to answer some of the questions posed by your Class and group choices.
Once you get past the prologue, your adventures are supposed to evolve in a natural
way: the Player Characters choose objectives and make choices, and the Game Master
presents obstacles and challenges for them to overcome while also populating the
world with new creatures and characters. When you sit down to play for the first time
it's easy to be unsure of where to begin. To help, there is a list of tables that generate
some context for a starting scene appropriate to your group choice.
THE QUESTIONS
You will notice that each entry on the prologue tables lists a few questions designed
to help you paint the initial scene. Said questions can be answered by anyone at the
table — whoever has a cool idea should simply go ahead and suggest it. Once you
have built the starting premise together, you can all slip into your roles — each Player
takes control of their character, and the Game Master takes control of the rest of the
game world.
Sometimes it will make sense for a Player Character to
already have strong feelings towards someone else —
perhaps they hate the Avalonian Empire or are loyal to their
family. If you use this optional rule, each Player Character
begins play with one Bond (with a single emotion).
This optional rule is excellent for shorter campaigns since these generally give
you less time to build Bonds between characters; it is also perfect for groups in
which two or more heroes already know each other, share some form of rivalry,
or belong to opposite factions — this is the kind of dramatic relationships you
want to see in play!

EXPERIENCE AND LEVELS
In Fabula Ultima, a character’s power is measured by their level: starting characters
enter the game at level 5, and the upper limit for a character is level 50.
GAINING EXPERIENCE POINTS
In order to increase their level and grow in power, a Player Character must earn
Experience Points, abbreviated as XP.
At the end of each game session, your character will gain a variable amount of
Experience Points, as summarized on your character sheet:
 Your character will automatically gain 5 XP. This ensures you achieve some progress
regardless of what happened during the session.
 Your character will also gain an amount of XP equal to the amount of Ultima Points
spent by Villains during the session. If the Villains spent lots of these, it means they
didn't pull their punches — and adversity will make you grow.
Because of this, it is a good idea to keep track of spent Ultima Points by placing
tokens inside a bowl or cup.
 Finally, your character will gain an amount of XP equal to the amount of Fabula
Points spent by the group during the session, divided by the number of Player
Characters that took part in the session. Whenever you spend Fabula Points, you are
making both yourself and your companions grow stronger!
Just like Ultima Points, you should keep track of spent Fabula Points by placing the
corresponding tokens inside a bowl or cup — and remember, you don't have to keep
track of which character spent them.
Additionally, a list of optional rules for advancement can be found on page 230. Use
them to customize your game!
 Adopting the blitz, embodiment, or MVP optional rules will cause characters to grow
faster. You might want to no longer award the automatic 5 Experience Points per
session. Discuss this with your group.
 When the game refers to "a session", it means a segment of gameplay lasting
approximately four hours. If your sessions are shorter or longer than that, you might
want to "check for Experience Points" every four hours of play.

CHAPTER
TRACKING EXPERIENCE AND GAINING LEVELS
When you gain Experience Points, keep track of them on your character sheet:
After gaining XP at the end of a session, you have a chance to increase your level:
if you have 10 or more Experience Points, you must spend ten of those points and
increase your character level by one — you keep any Experience Points in excess. Note
that regardless of how many Experience Points you have, even if they are multiples of
ten, you may only gain one level per session this way.
GAINING A NEW CHARACTER LEVEL
For each new level your character gains, they receive several benefits:
 You may change your character's Identity and/or Theme.
 Increase your maximum Hit Points and Mind Points by one point each. Note that this
does not affect your current Hit Points and Mind Points.
 If you just reached level 20 or 40, choose one of your Attributes and increase its base
die size by one step, up to a maximum of d12.
This is the only way you can ever increase your Attributes; whenever you do so, some
of your other statistics might change (see next page).
 You increase the level of one of your character’s Classes by one, or you gain your first
level in a Class you didn’t already have (see next page).
There are, however, two important limitations when leveling up:
 You can never have more than ten levels in a Class. Once you put the tenth level in a
Class, that Class has been mastered (which grants you a Heroic Skill, as explained on
the next page) and you can no longer invest levels into it.
 You can never have more than three non-mastered Classes. If you want to further
diversify your character, you must first master some of the Classes you acquired.
EXPERIENCE POINTS 12
228
W
INCREASING YOUR ATTRIBUTES
When you increase one of your four Attributes, keep in mind it might influence your
maximum Hit Points, maximum Mind Points, Defense and Magic Defense:
 Your maximum Hit Points are equal to your total character level + five times your
character’s base Might die size.
Your Crisis score is equal to half your maximum Hit Points, rounded down.
 Your maximum Mind Points are equal to your total character level + five times your
character’s base Willpower die size.
 Your Defense is equal to your current Dexterity die size.
 Your Magic Defense is equal to your current Insight die size.
Note that these numbers may further be modified by your character’s choices of Class,
Skills and equipment.
PUTTING LEVELS IN CHARACTER CLASSES
Just like when you created your character, putting a level in a Class allows you to
acquire one of its Class Skills — either a Skill you don’t have, or one that you have but
may be acquired multiple times (ç).
 Your level in any given Class can never exceed 10. When you bring a Class up to level
10, you have mastered it: acquire one Heroic Skill of your choice (see page 232).
Note that this Heroic Skill will be in addition to the Class Skill you normally acquire
by investing the tenth level in that Class.
 If a Skill can be acquired multiple times, it will also indicate how many times you can
acquire it, such as (ç5) for a Skill that can be acquired up to five times, or (ç10) for
a Skill that can be acquired up to ten times.
 If you put a level in a Class you didn’t previously have, you also gain the free benefits
granted by that Class. Mixing and matching a variety of Classes can be useful — just
don’t forget to master some of them!

CHAPTER
CHANGING IDENTITY OR THEME
If you choose to change your Identity and/or Theme upon gaining a level, explain
what prompted this change: perhaps you have abandoned Anger and learned the
importance of Mercy, or your days as an Oathsworn Paladin have come to an end, and
you are now a Rebellious Oathbreaker.
Don't be afraid of change: use it as a way to signal to your group that you want to
explore a new side of your character!
CREATING HIGH LEVEL CHARACTERS
If your group decides to start play at a level higher than five, you should simply create
your characters as normal and then proceed to level them up as needed.
You may also want to increase the amount of zenit to purchase starting equipment
with; an increase of 50 zenit per level should be appropriate — a level 30 character
would have a starting budget of 2000 zenit, for example.
Rare items and accessories should also be made available to higher-level characters.
REPLACING A CHARACTER
Sometimes a Player Character will die a heroic death, or the Player might decide
that their story arc had reached a satisfying conclusion; if a Player switches to a new
character, the new character is created with a level equal to that of their previous
character, and with the same amount of Experience Points.
So long as we don't forget the tears and smiles we shared,
the fallen will live on forever.
Sooner or later, your character will gain Classes they didn’t
have at the start, which may lead to seemingly strange and
unforeseen combinations.
But does gaining a few levels in Chimerist turn your mage
researcher into a druid? The answer is no.
When your character picks a Class that is very different from their initial concept,
they are experimenting and evolving: where a druid would seek communion with
beasts, your mage might coldly analyze their abilities.
Embrace the variety of Class combinations and craft memorable characters!
"WEIRD" CHARACTERS

W
d BLITZ
Player Characters will gain additional Experience at the end of each battle in which
all enemies fled or were reduced to 0 Hit Points. The amount gained by each character
will be equal to【 5 minus the number of rounds elapsed during the battle】; this
means that any battle concluded during the sixth round will grant no additional
Experience, while a battle that was completed during the first round will award five
XP to each participant.
 These additional Experience Points are gained by all characters who took part in the
battle (even if they surrendered or fled at a certain point).
 Combine this with Superiority Points (page 83) for a highly tactical game!
It's good if: You like your battles to be intensely tactical, and you're okay with your
campaign mostly revolving around combat. If you choose this optional rule, the Game
Master will have to spend some more time making sure each encounter is challenging
but also allows for clever strategies.
d BOOSTER
Each Player Character will automatically gain a level at the end of each session (in
addition to normal advancement).
It's good if: Your campaign will be relatively short, if the Players like to have plenty
of new tricks every session, and if you don't mind turning your game into a quickly
escalating spiral of mayhem.
Depending on the campaign, you might want to use one or
more of the optional rules.
You can also introduce new advancement rules halfway
through the campaign, or stop using them if you realize they
are doing more harm than good.
What's important for you to understand is that the optional XP rules you apply
will inevitably shift the focus of your game: after all, people generally tend to do
what they're rewarded for.

CHAPTER
d EMBODIMENT
The group will vote for the Player who better embodied their character's Identity and/
or Theme during the session — the chosen Player's character gains an additional 2 XP.
If two or more Players are tied, they will each gain this bonus Experience!
A few rules apply however: you cannot be awarded this bonus XP twice in a row, and
you cannot vote for yourself or for the Game Master.
If you are using this optional rule as well as MVP (see below), the two rewards must
go to different Players. Vote for Embodiment before you vote for MVP.
It's good if: You like to roleplay intense scenes and you don't run the risk of a single
person outshining everyone else or making things uncomfortable by stealing the
spotlight all the time. If you see this happening, you should stop using this option.
d MVP
The group will vote for a Most Valuable Player at the end of each session — the chosen
Player's character gains an additional 2 XP. If two or more Players are tied, they will
each gain this bonus Experience!
Just like with Embodiment, you cannot be awarded this bonus XP twice in a row, and
you cannot vote for yourself or the Game Master.
If you are using this optional rule as well as Embodiment (see above), the two rewards
must go to different Players. Vote for Embodiment before you vote for MVP.
It's good if: Your group wants to reward proactive Players who take a hit for the team
or turn the tables on their adversaries.
If you use the Embodiment or MVP optional rules, some
characters might end up being a few levels above others.
The system won't suffer unless this gap is five or greater, but
you should carefully discuss whether the optional rules are
fostering a healthy play environment.
If someone is frustrated by these rules, even if it's only one person, you should
stop using them.

DISARMING RHETORIC
Requirements: You must have mastered the Orator Class.

CHAPTER
HOPE
Requirements: You must have mastered the Spiritist Class.
You learn the ultimate Spiritist spell: Hope.
Hope MP: 40 Target: Special Duration: Instantaneous
You rekindle the flames of courage and hope within a defeated hero. Choose a Player
Character who surrendered but is still present on the scene: that Player Character
immediately regains consciousness and recovers an amount of Hit Points equal to their
Crisis score. Note that this spell will not undo the consequences of the character's
surrender and is of no use if the character left the scene as part of their surrender —
such as if they were captured and dragged away, or if they were trapped in a parallel
dimension, and so on.
A Player Character may only be affected by this spell once per scene; if a character is
brought back into the conflict by this spell and is subsequently reduced to 0 Hit Points
again, they must sacrifice themselves or surrender as per the normal rules (including
a new consequence and 2 more Fabula Points if they surrender).
MATHEMAGIC
Requirements: You must have mastered the Loremaster Class.

MP cost. If you do, choose an Attribute (Dexterity, Insight, Might, or Willpower) and a
die size (d6, d8, d10 or d12). The spell now targets all creatures present on the scene
whose current Attribute die size matches your choice, regardless of whether they are
friends or foes (you might even end up targeting yourself). The effects of the spell are
fully applied to every target.
If the spell is an offensive (r) spell, it follows the normal rules: you perform a single
Magic Check and confront it with the Magic Defense of each target to determine who
is hit by the spell.

creature, or inflict a status effect on each creature while also lowering their Mind
Points).
PILLAGE
Requirements: You must have mastered the Rogue Class, and must have acquired the
Soul Steal Skill.
When you use the Soul Steal Skill, you may target any number of creatures at the same

creature's Traits. If you do so, choose one type of action among the following: Attack,
Guard, Objective, Spell, or Skill. Until the start of your next turn, the creature must
spend 20 Mind Points whenever they wish to perform that action. If they can't, they
must perform a different action.

CHAPTER
GAME MASTER
This chapter contains advice and procedures for Fabula Ultima Game Masters.
Your main job as a Game Master is breathing life into the world your group has created.
Together, you have planted the seeds of your campaign: now you must tend to those
seeds and help everything blossom.
While the Players are responsible for portraying heroic characters and steering the
direction of the story by establishing goals and making decisions, your duty is to
portray the rest of the world and challenge the protagonists: the resulting conflicts
and struggles are what makes the game memorable.
NO ONE IS BORN A GM
When it comes to being a capable Game Master, experience is key. No amount
of painstakingly precise notes and preparation can save you from mistakes or
experiencing a lackluster game session — and that’s okay. Even the most experienced
Game Masters and Players make mistakes, and sometimes there will be issues outside
the game that prevent your group from having a good time.
Take those mistakes and learn from your experiences, get the entire group involved
in the creative process, and combine all of this with the advice provided throughout
this chapter. By doing this, it will help everyone both enjoy playing the game and
developing an incredible story.
HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER
What you will find in the following pages is a variety of tools designed to make your
life as a Game Master easier. Read this chapter carefully before playing the game, and
come back to read it again after one or two sessions.
Many things will be clearer once you have experienced how the game works in play.

W
THE GAME MASTER'S ROLE
Whether this is your first time as a Game Master or you are a veteran of a hundred
different games, Fabula Ultima requires you to fulfill some specific roles and duties
at the table.
Part of these have been summarized on page 26 of the Introduction chapter, but it's
time we discuss what you'll be doing in a bit more detail!
BEFORE PLAY
When you're getting ready for session zero — in which you will create the world and
the Player Characters — do the following:
 Learn the rules. Read this book as thoroughly as you can, and pay special attention
to the rules on Checks, Clocks, and Conflicts. During the first few sessions you might
likely end up misremembering some stuff, and that's perfectly normal: just pause the
game and look up the rule in question. Take your time.
Encourage everyone else to learn the rules as well so that they can help you and
make the most out of their characters.
 Gather inspiration. Look for pictures, music, and artwork that strike you as inspiring
and appropriate to the tone of the game — character portraits, landscapes, and
creatures. During the first session, these will help fire up everyone's imagination and
creativity.
Encourage everyone else to look for artwork and share it as well!
 Take a look at the different Classes. If you have time, familiarize yourself with the
various character options in the book — this way, you will be able to help Players
create their characters!

GAME MASTER

CHAPTER
DURING SESSION ZERO
Once your group is ready to start a new journey in Fabula Ultima, make sure to:
 Help everyone else. Help everyone find useful information in the book, offer ideas
and prompt everyone to take this new world into their hands. You are not here to tell
them a story; you are here to help them write their own.
 Ask questions. When a Player picks a certain option for their character, have them
tell everyone more about it — where did they learn this? What's their combat style?
Why did they choose this specific Theme? The questions provided by each Class entry
can be a huge help; remember to jot down notes so that you'll remember the Players'
answers later.
(Everyone always ends up forgetting something important, and notes help!)
 Stir the creative juices. Show your enthusiasm for the Players' choices and encourage
them to add new narrative elements and make the world their own. Consider using
music and artwork to get everyone in the right "mood", but make sure these elements
aren't distracting.
 Think about threats and Villains. As your group defines the history of your world and
the initial situation of the prologue, start thinking about the first antagonists they
will meet. You can find further advice on Villains starting on page 254.
It is often a good idea to showcase an early Villain during the prologue itself or
shortly afterward — if possible, pick someone the heroes have already recognized as
a threat and use this antagonist to get the action moving; save the subtler Villains
for later!
 Keep track of changes. While building the premises of the story, the group might
suddenly realize some previous choices no longer make sense. Since you will be the
one keeping track of all information concerning the game world, make sure to update
your notes whenever a change is approved by the group.
 Start things off with a bang. Don't be afraid to set some high stakes during the
prologue — while slow buildups can work, an explosive beginning is often more
memorable. Perhaps we first meet our heroes while they're being chased by a huge
monster, or hours away from being executed for treason.
Do your best to keep everyone engaged and on their toes from the very start!
246
W
DURING PLAY
During each session, adhere to the following principles:
 Portray a wondrous world. Give your NPCs unique quirks and add memorable touches
to every location, but don't get bogged down by details. Keep the descriptions short
and then let everyone ask questions.
 Manage information. A big part of your job during each session has to do with
information — you will be asked plenty of questions, from the shape of a room to a
person's behavior. You decide whether the characters know such information (based
on simple observation or on who they are) or if a Check is required — the dice will
determine how much the character knows about someone or something, or if they at
least know where they could find that information.
 Seek input from others. If something is relevant to a character's role in the story
(especially their Classes and Identities), you should ask for the Player's input — let
them establish facts about the shared game world.
 React to the heroes' choices. Be ready to adapt to the heroes' actions and goals;
leave them free to adopt whatever strategy they choose, but apply the consequences
of those strategies and don't pull your punches.
 Enforce transparency. Make sure everyone at the table knows what's at stake when
they perform Checks or choose a specific course of action.
 Keep the pressure high. Whatever the Player Characters want to achieve, someone
or something will block their path. Heroes should never have enough time to do
everything — put them in front of hard choices. Use Clocks to show impending threats
and make sure Villains play an active role in the story.
 Think cinematically. Describe situations and actions as if they were cutscenes from a
videogame — keep things moving and make sure everything feels vivid and dynamic.
This is especially important during conflict scenes, when the strategic aspect of the
game is at its peak: mechanics and descriptions go hand in hand.
 Start and end scenes. When you feel like a scene has been resolved, propose to end
it. If anyone still wants to do something, they should tell you — otherwise, move on
with the story.
 Design interesting battles. Avoid "filler battles" and focus on intense and dramatic
confrontations with powerful antagonists. See page 292 for more.

GAME MASTER

CHAPTER
BETWEEN SESSIONS
When preparing for the next session, you should:
 Think about the heroes' choices. Reflect upon the actions and choices made by the
Player Characters during the previous sessions and come up with a variety of possible
situations, threats and antagonists. Keep the heroes' objectives in mind and think
about how you can build interesting conflicts and struggles around them. This is less
about writing tons of scenes and dialogue, and more about going for a walk with
some cool music and envisioning amazing sequences in your head.
 Think about what the Villains are doing. Villains are the most powerful forces
opposing the Player Characters' actions, and you should spend some time considering
what their short and long-term plans are.
You should also make sure to update a Villain's level and abilities so that they can
properly challenge the Player Characters during conflict scenes.
 Ask the Players what their goals and objectives are. As you prepare for the next
session, contact the Players and ask them about their plans. Will they storm the
Emperor's palace? Are they going to search the depths of the Azure Cave? Or do they
plan to gather clues to prove someone's innocence?
Knowing the general focus of the coming session will help you save time and make
the most out of your preparation; ask these questions at the end of a session, when
recent events are still fresh in everyone's memory.
 Design new creatures. Sooner or later, the creatures in the Bestiary will no longer
suit your needs — whenever you have time, use the rules on page 302 to create new
creatures and adversaries for your campaign, mainly focusing on the kind of territory
the group is currently traversing.
This will become increasingly easier as you play the game: not only will you grow
more familiar with the rules, but you will also better understand the Player Characters'
abilities. If you don't get any immediate use out of a creature you designed, don't
worry too much — you can always tweak it a little bit and bring it back later when
the occasion arises!
 Look for inspiration. Watch movies and TV series, read comics and books, play video
games and search for inspiring artwork online. Exposing yourself to a variety of
different stories and aesthetics is a great way to make each session feel unique —
you'll never run out of ideas.
The Prince of Megara has fallen gravely ill.
Rumor has it he was aiding the Olcressian Rebellion.
248
W
CHARACTER CLASSES
When Players choose to invest levels in a Class, it means they care about what that
Class can contribute to the game. Mechanically, Classes are bundles of Skills — but
they also influence the character's general concept and inform the kind of scenes that
will take place during the game, as well as the adversaries you will create.
Below you will find useful advice on how to help your group make the most out of
their character Classes, and how to build situations around their abilities. Pay special
attention to what Classes are chosen during character creation since they will
determine the character's role and abilities for quite a while.
ARCANIST
 Arcana should play an important role in the setting. Perhaps a cult or religious empire
worships them, or they are seen as proof of noble lineage.
 Spend some time thinking up the kind of quest or trial required to bind each Arcanum.
These should be tied to the Arcanum’s powers and concept — for instance, binding the
Tower might require sacrificing something dear in order to protect others.
 Create new Arcana in addition to the ones presented in this book, using those as a
guideline. If the Arcanist is also a Loremaster or comes from a long line of summoners,
you should create these new Arcana together with the Player.
 An Arcanist's progression is based upon encountering new Arcana. Keep this in mind
and make sure they get chances to do so.
CHIMERIST
 Build scenes in which the conflict between nature and technology is central. Put
the Chimerist in situations where they are expected to take a side: ecological and
environmental themes should be a main plot point.
 Include multiple creatures from which the Chimerist can learn spells — beasts,
monsters, and plants. Do this at least once every other session. One good strategy is
to straight-out ask the Player what kind of spells they would like to learn and then
design creatures from which they can be learned!
See page 302 for the rules concerning creature design.

GAME MASTER
249
W
CHAPTER
DARKBLADE
 If someone picks the Darkblade as the core concept for their character, the tragedy
that awakened their powers should play a major role in the story. Have the Player talk
about it, then create scenes that bring back echoes of that dark past.
 Due to their ability to negate dark damage, undead are extremely resilient to a
Darkblade's Shadow Strike. Keep this in mind when designing battles.
 There might come a time when the Darkblade can finally leave their past behind.
When this happens, you might have their Skills "flipped" — maybe they can now create
Bonds of affection with Heart of Hope and unleash light damage with Celestial
Strike. Discuss this option with the Player and see if it's something that interests them.
ELEMENTALIST
 Elemental magic is mostly focused around dealing damage of several types: when
you design battles, make sure this ability gets to shine. Create adversaries that absorb
certain elements and are vulnerable to others, so that the Elementalist’s contribution
may be key to victory.
 Given its raw power, elemental magic is often used in battle. If this type of spellcaster
is common in your setting, it probably contributed to shaping the history of warfare.
This is something you should discuss with your Elementalist Player.
ENTROPIST
 Entropic magic is deeply tied to death, chaos and oblivion. It can be easily seen as
"villainous” magic, but the Player Characters are heroes. Create situations in which
this contrast becomes important!
 Entropists are among the few characters capable of dealing damage with no type,
causing direct HP loss, limiting enemy actions, and granting allies additional turns.
Create conflicts where these abilities can prove vital.
 Ritual Entropism can achieve incredible effects, such as altering time and space.
These Rituals are expensive and dangerous, but a Player Character is still free to
attempt them; just remember that failure will be proportionally devastating.
250
W
FURY
 Anger and passion are the core elements of a Fury. Build scenes in which acting
upon instinct can be detrimental, and always show the consequences of violence
or recklessness. There’s a reason Furies are seen as ticking bombs by most people
around them, and some might feel unsafe when a Fury is present.
 In battle, hit the Fury hard — they are quite resilient and can deal serious damage
when in Crisis. Hurt them, and they will hurt you back twice as hard.
 Given their temper, Furies are generally well-known in their land of origin... they do
tend to cause trouble, after all. Discuss the Fury’s “reputation” with the Player.
GUARDIAN
 Create occasions for heroism and situations in which a Guardian must choose between
themselves and others. Particularly interesting are the moments in which a Guardian
has the ability to protect someone who was once their enemy — what will they do?
 Keep in mind the Protect Skill only works on one target at a time — a threat affecting
an entire area will force the Player to make difficult decisions. Build on this.
 A Guardian adversary risking their life to protect a Villain (out of loyalty or even love)
can make for an especially tragic figure — one the heroes may respect.
LOREMASTER
 When a Loremaster Player asks you a question, remember — they are supposed to
know a little bit about everything. Be generous when handing out information to
them, and remember to often involve them in the description of a scene or location.
Let them showcase their knowledge by adding details to a place, item, or person.
 If a Loremaster acquires the Quick Assessment Skill, make sure to reveal useful Traits
when they use it. Revealing the "winged" Trait on a dragon feels like a cheap move,
while Traits like "coward" or "loyal" are much more interesting and useful.

CHAPTER
ORATOR
 Orators are assumed to draw attention. Maybe they look good, maybe they’re naturally
charismatic, or maybe there’s some other reason — you should ask the Player.
 Words are powerful. They can save people just as much as they can bring ruin.
Never forget to show an Orator the consequences of their threats and promises, and
remember that some will be envious or wary of their charm and popularity.
 When an Orator uses Condemn, ask them what they say. If their argument is especially
strong or weak, apply a situational modifier to their Check (+2 if they have some
leverage, -2 if they're in over their head).
 Unexpected Ally is a powerful Skill, but it's no "mind control". If the character abuses
the target's loyalty and trust, the benefit will quickly be lost. Make it clear to the
Orator if they're asking too much of their newfound ally.
ROGUE
 Whatever ideals spur a Rogue into action can often be twisted and manipulated. It is
dreadfully easy for a rebel to turn into an oppressor, and the heroes of the past were
often treated like criminals during their own time.
 Most people will be wary of helping a Rogue, especially if they belong to a criminal
guild or organization. Discuss these details of the setting with your Rogue Player —
perhaps they have their very own secret language and hideouts!
 The Rogue’s Soul Steal Skill allows them to gain precious items that embody the
essence of their adversaries. Said items should tell a story about the creature they
originated from: for instance, a particularly spiteful and envious adversary might have
a flesh eater sword (see page 278) as its soul treasure, since it represents how their
sentiments are gnawing at their very spirit. On the other hand, a ruthless person that
only cares about wealth might harbor a cold yet valuable diamond.
Remember that items acquired this way are in addition to normal game rewards
(page 264). Because of this, the group will inevitably gain access to more options and
wealth than normal — but that’s part of what makes a Rogue special.
Don’t be afraid to give the Player Characters some new toys!
"Goddess of Law? How fitting! As a thief,
I'll defend my right to disobey until the very end!"
252
W
SHARPSHOOTER
 As one of the more combat-oriented Classes in the game, a Sharpshooter is relatively
straightforward: they do one thing, and they do it well. When designing battles for
your group, create situations in which their abilities can shine - flying enemies, in
particular, are the bane of melee combatants.
 If the Sharpshooter has spent some time in the army, build on that. Talk with the
Player and discuss warfare, battles, and historical events - they will probably know
the names of a few different generals and military leaders.
SPIRITIST
 If people realize a Spiritist is among them, they may grow wary or even frightened:
after all, Spiritism can influence the mind and emotions. This can be a truly dreadful
ability... think what it could do in the hands of a Villain.
 If a Spiritist makes frequent use of Ritual Spiritism to alter the feelings, thoughts, and
emotions of people, there’s a good chance someone will get angry; make sure the
character is faced with the consequences of their manipulations.
 Spiritists manipulate soul energy in its purest form, and this power is strongly tied
with the concepts of life and death. If you have a Spiritist in your group, you should
spend some time exploring these themes.
 Is the Spiritist part of a church or similar organization? Do they believe their powers
come from a deity? And if yes, what does this entity ask of them in return?
 Spiritists can help the group quickly recover from damage and status effects. Keep
this in mind when creating challenging situations.
 Given how reliably their spells can deal light damage, Spiritists excel against undead
adversaries. Remember this when designing battles!

CHAPTER
TINKERER
 Technology can be powerful and terrifying. Build situations related to the dangers of
ruthless and unethical progress and challenge the Tinkerer to prove why their view
of science is different.
 Tinkerers excel at crafting inventions and are an amazing Class for the more creative
Players. Be ready to work with your Tinkerer when coming up with inventions, and
work with them to establish unique Inventory Items available in your world!
 Tinkerers are very flexible: they have access to all damage types and can provide
excellent support with healing items. Remember this when designing battles.
WAYFARER
 Given how frequent discoveries can become if your group includes a Wayfarer with
the Treasure Hunter and/or Well-traveled Skills, it may be a good idea to prepare a
quick list of interesting discoveries that may come useful in a pinch.
 When short on ideas, turn to the Wayfarer Player and ask them to tell you more
about the local area, the terrain, and the creatures that live there. Then, build on their
answers during the session!
 The Faithful Companion Skill is a powerful option that brings a whole new character
into the party. Design the creature together with the Player, and don't be afraid to
adjust its stats along the way if you see that it's too underwhelming or if it outshines
the rest of the party. The best companions are those that support the group!
WEAPONMASTER
 In times of war, capable warriors are an asset. In times of peace, they are a threat. The
feats of a Weaponmaster will surely earn them respect... and attract trouble.
 Consider introducing a rival Weaponmaster in the campaign — a recurring foe with
their own beliefs and peculiar combat style.
 Most Weaponmasters learned from an exceptional mentor. Creating this figure in
collaboration with the Player and giving them a role in the story, as an ally or an
unexpected antagonist, can add depth to the character.
254
W
THE ART OF VILLAINS
If the Player Characters represent a heroic and positive force in the world, Villains are
the opposite. Being the Game Master, it is your responsibility to create, introduce, and
portray these characters.
You already know about what differentiates a Villain from a typical Non-Player
Character in terms of rules: that is to say, the access to Ultima Points. This section,
on the other hand, contains advice on what you should focus on when creating and
portraying an antagonist within the story.
So, let’s get to it: what makes a good Villain?
GOALS
This is the most important aspect of any antagonist: they want to accomplish
something. Be it reshaping the world, exacting revenge upon those who made them
suffer, or conquering a neighboring region, Villains must have goals.
Goals are extremely useful for you as a Game Master: when you don’t know how a
Villain would act or react to a given situation, look at their goals and you will most
likely find an answer.
 Minor Villains generally have simple or at least very personal goals, such as saving
someone's life, stealing a magical artifact, or seizing control of a village.
 Major Villains should have complex goals that can affect a large number of people,
such as conquering a kingdom, or destroying a divine being.
 Supreme Villains have goals that can affect the entire world and change the laws of
reality: rewinding time, erasing soul energy, or even becoming a deity.
Remember that Villains can also escalate: perhaps a young wizard (minor Villain)
suddenly realizes he must steal magical energy from an entire country to revive a
loved one, thus becoming a major Villain. Then, when the attempt fails — likely due to
the Player Characters’ intervention — the desperate wizard seeks a way to merge with
the deities of time and space, erasing reality and creating a timeline that never was...
a fitting and tragic goal for a supreme Villain.
Having some Villains turn into allies throughout the campaign is just as important:
this encourages Players to seek dialogue with their adversaries and to consider both
sides of a situation, instead of simply assuming that everyone is either good or evil.
4
GAME MASTER
255
W
CHAPTER
PRESSURE
Your Villains should actively work towards their goals. If the Player Characters spend
an extended amount of time resting or taking care of issues that are not related to an
antagonist’s plans, then that antagonist will not sit idly and wait for the heroes to do
something: they will get closer to their objective.
When a Villain’s plans advance, you must always clearly communicate it to the
Players — perhaps with an appropriate Game Master scene, or through rumors and
conversations the heroes have with NPCs in the game world. Don’t just surprise them
with a casual “Oh yeah, did I mention this guy you didn’t know about has successfully
rewritten reality?”
If you plan on having multiple Villains in your campaign at the same time — or if you
play at very irregular intervals and it's hard to remember everything — consider using
Clocks to track the progress of each Villain’s goals.
The more complex or dramatic objectives will require larger Clocks:
 Minor Villains should have Clocks with 4 to 6 sections.
 Major Villains should have Clocks with 8 to 10 sections.
 Supreme Villains should have Clocks with 10 to 12 sections.
If the Player Characters manage to foil the Villain’s plans, the current Clock will reset
to 0 or possibly be replaced with an entirely different one, representing how the
antagonist is now seeking to achieve the same end through a different method.
AN UNEXPECTED SIDE
Never create one-dimensional antagonists. Villains should have a deeper layer, a tragic
or at least unexpected side to them: perhaps they genuinely think they are doing the
world a favor, they have their own reasons for forsaking everyone else, or they feel
trapped in a path of ruin and are simply waiting for someone to stop them. Maybe an
antagonist is so honorable that they will fully heal the heroes before a battle!
This doesn’t mean the PCs should necessarily sympathize with all Villains — a few will
be beyond redemption. But even then, dark emotions must come from somewhere...
and upon discovering those tragic roots, Player Characters will see that antagonist
under a different light, and perhaps even find a way to help them realize that what
they're doing is harmful.
256
W
THE DARK MIRROR
If you think about the most memorable villains in movies, comics, and games, you will
soon find that many of them share a peculiar quality: in one or more ways, they are
polar opposite to the hero(es) of the tale.
 Where the heroes are a group, the antagonist feels alone and abandoned.
 Where the heroes fight for justice, the antagonist now believes that justice is an
illusion, and that the world belongs to those strong enough to take it.
 Where the heroes are willing to give up their life for the cause, the antagonist is
frightened by death.
 Where the heroes believe in second chances, the antagonist has been denied one.
 Where the heroes represent hope, the antagonist represents despair.
When you create a Villain, try to think about at least one aspect of their character that
makes them the dark reflection of one or more Player Characters.
As you introduce that antagonist and whenever they are part of a scene, focus on
portraying that they are a negation of what the heroes stand for, or as a grim warning
to what they might become if they ever lose their way.
STYLE AND MANNERISM
Spend a few minutes thinking about how a Villain speaks, acts, moves and dresses.
Are they dashing and refined, or do they care little for appearances? Do they wear a
specific uniform? Do all of their henchmen emulate them?
Please note that “mannerism” has nothing to do with acting Skills or the ability to
do different voices — it means that each Villain should behave in a peculiar and
recognizable way, and you should describe that. Then again, if you’re good at coming
up with unique accents and your group enjoys it — and provided those accents do not
mirror harmful stereotypes — then feel free to take advantage of that Skill!

GAME MASTER
257
W
CHAPTER
CONFLICT ABILITIES
When you create an antagonist, consider how they will behave during conflicts.
 Each Villain has one or more preferred conflict types: some might favor social
occasions; others may prefer to engage the heroes in battle. The most obnoxious
antagonists are the ones that avoid conflict scenes at all costs — but even then,
Ultima Points aren't an infinite resource.
 To properly challenge the heroes, Villains should be elites or champions (see page
295) or be accompanied by some allies: this is to ensure they can perform multiple
actions during each conflict round.
 Because of their importance, a battle against a Villain should be treated as a boss
fight (see page 300 for details on how to design one).
Powerful antagonists might also be protected by a “plot armor” that prevents Player
Characters from fighting them unless they have a specific item, spell, or other assets at
their disposal. Generally you don’t want to overdo this — one or two such “tricks” over
the course of the entire campaign are more than enough.
AND FINALLY, A DRAMATIC ENTRANCE
A Villain’s entrance should be an intense moment that sets the tone for their role in
the story. Think of it as a video game cutscene: you get a few seconds to show your
audience what this Villain looks like and hint at the kind of forces and weapons at
their disposal — soldiers, forgotten technology, powerful magic, or a healthy dose of
supernatural strength.
During your preparation stage before a session, it may be helpful to focus on the
reveals key moments — you have to condense everything important in a couple of
sentences. It should be something like this:
Approaching with heavy footfalls, the figure rests a hand on a sword the likes of which
you’ve never seen... a delicate gesture, but her grip is steady.
“It appears we are here for the same reason,” she says. “Unfortunately, I cannot let you
have that which I need. Stand back, and no one shall be injured.”
With a few words, you have communicated that this is likely a proud and honorable
adversary who is also very determined. That sword of hers? That’s bad news!
"When you chose to fight not to protect your people,
but to prove them wrong... that is what made you a villain."
258
W
DUNGEONS
Page 110 provides guidelines on how to manage dungeon exploration while playing
— but what about preparing those dungeons? How much information will you need?
Should you have a map of the location ready?
To make sure this is clear from the beginning: dungeons aren't necessarily a thing in
Fabula Ultima, and you might run an entire campaign without the Player Characters
ever entering one.
A dungeon generally covers one or more of the following functions:
 Slowly eroding the heroes' resources before an important confrontation by having
them face several weaker enemies.
 Telling more about a character, place or people.
 Rewarding careful exploration with hidden treasures that may prove useful in the
dungeon itself or a future situation.
If a dungeon isn't doing any of these, you probably shouldn't have it in your game:
"dungeons for the sake of dungeons" is never a good idea.
PREPARED AND IMPROVISED
The first distinction we should make is between prepared dungeons (the ones you
thought about before the session started) and improvised dungeons (the ones that
were introduced as part of the current session).
While prepared dungeons can be more complex, the ones you have to improvise on
the spot will necessarily be simpler — but simple doesn't mean boring.
 A prepared dungeon allows for all three modes of exploration; most of the time you
will rely on dungeon scenes or detailed exploration (page 110), but if the layout of
the place isn't important you might even get it done with an interlude scene.
 An improvised dungeon, on the other hand, will rarely allow for detailed exploration
(unless you have a dungeon archive ready; see page 261) and generally fall in the
middle between dungeon scenes and interludes.
Note that this distinction has nothing to do with the importance of the dungeon: a
key strategic location might be unexpectedly introduced halfway through a session,
and you might know about a minor ruin along the road with no plot relevance weeks
before you play through its exploration. Don't worry, we'll deal with this too.

CHAPTER
IS THIS DUNGEON IMPORTANT?
Some locations in your game will naturally be more important than others. The
evil sorcerer's tower in which he hides the Crystal of Balance? That's certainly more
important than the sewers connecting the capital to the countryside, and yet both
might be turned into dungeons.
 If a location will be a key part of your session and you know about it in advance,
simply decide the style of exploration (scenes, detailed, or interlude) and prepare
accordingly (see next page).
 If a location is important and you have to improvise it, only mention the most
important details and cut to the chase. Interlude scenes are your best friend, and you
should focus on the core reason the Player Characters are here: if there are obstacles
in their way, ask for a Group Check and use it to determine whether the PCs reach
their objective unhindered or must overcome a challenge. Keep things short and
maybe end the exploration with a challenging battle against a Villain!
Still, if you feel like this location deserves more attention, you can pause or end the
session and explain that you need some time to prepare.
 If a location isn't particularly important and you have time to prepare it, carefully
consider whether you should do so. You will often be fine describing how the heroes
traverse the location (a) and maybe calling for one or two Checks — failure might
mean getting lost (especially important if the heroes are in a hurry) or encountering
some hostile creatures.
 Finally, if a location isn't important and you have to improvise, you should keep
things as simple as possible. Just describe the place and have the heroes confront a
challenge — a mechanism, a negotiation, or a battle — in order to reach whatever is
hidden here.
As you might have noticed already, the core elements of a dungeon are:
 Its style and aesthetics — what it looks and feels like.
 What can be found inside — an objective or a threat.
 What obstacles must be overcome in order to traverse the dungeon.
This is true regardless of the chosen exploration style; the difference lies simply in the
level of detail and complexity.
260
W
PREPARING A DUNGEON
If you have time to prepare a dungeon and know the Player Characters will explore it,
the following process generally works well:
OW
Think about the general look and mood of the dungeon: is it a spooky ruin, a
lavish castle, or perhaps a network of ancient tunnels?
1
OW
Sketch a rough map of the dungeon: this doesn't need to be pretty, but does
need to be functional. You're the only person that will use it, so make sure your
notes are clear (especially if you plan on using the dungeon weeks or even
months from now). If you're short on ideas, internet is filled with awesome
dungeon designs — there's nothing wrong with drawing inspiration from them.
2
OW
Place rewards (see page 264) in your dungeon: these may be magic items,
currency, or even Inventory Points. Try to avoid placing most of the rewards in
the same room (you should encourage exploration).
3
OW
Place obstacles and threats (traps, puzzles, hostile creatures) in your dungeon,
preferably so that they guard or prevent access to rewards.
 When you prepare an obstacle or threat, do not determine in advance how
the Player Characters might approach it. That's for them to decide.
 Avoid swarming the heroes with a large number of weak enemies; instead,
focus on two or three challenging encounters (see page 292 for more).
 If the reward is an item, the creature guarding it might use it in battle.
4
OW
Think about one or two Danger Clocks appropriate for your dungeon, their size
and what will happen if they are filled — will the heroes be ambushed? Is there
a magical surveillance system? Will the tunnels be flooded by lava?
5
OW
Determine the focal point of your dungeon (an antagonist, a precious artifact,
a vital piece of information) and choose its location. Most of the time you will
want to place this element far away from the entrance, but you might also make
it relatively easy to reach (in this case, the rest of the dungeon will feature
"optional content").

CHAPTER
THE DUNGEON ARCHIVE
If you and your group are particularly fond of detailed dungeon exploration, and if
your schedule allows for it, you might want to prepare your own dungeon archive.
This is straightforward: whenever you have some time, jot down a few notes about
potential dungeons — a notebook is fine, but you might also choose to keep them on
your device or inside the cloud storage. Then, whenever you need to "improvise" a
dungeon, you can instead grab one from your archive. You'll probably need to make
a few adjustments on the fly, but it's easier than having to come up with everything
on the spot.
When preparing dungeons for your archive, keep the following in mind:
 Flexibility. Make sure your prepared dungeons can fit a variety of situations and
environments. This will largely depend on your group's campaign world, but each
dungeon should be appropriate for at least two or three areas in your world map.
 Internet is your friend. Download, print or save a variety of dungeon maps from
videogames and other tabletop games (but make sure you only do so for your
personal use).
You can of course draw your own dungeon layouts: an activity some find very relaxing,
but one that can prove quite time-consuming as well. Be mindful about how you
spend your effort!
 Connections. One of the advantages when preparing several dungeons ahead of time
is that you can tie some or all of them together in many ways. You could design a set
of four temples, each tied to a natural element, and place them all over the map; or
you could have one dungeon contain clues to the position of another.
The biggest risk when relying on the dungeon archive is to "shoehorn" a dungeon you
prepared into a location, or to refrain from an otherwise cool and unique improvised
design just because it feels safer to use a prepared dungeon instead.
As the Game Master, it is your responsibility to find a balance between prepared and
improvised dungeons — both have their pros and cons.

REWARDS
Few things can make Players excited as finding treasures and rewards: whether
retrieved from the depths of a perilous labyrinth or gifted by a grateful sovereign,
these allow our heroes to develop new strategies, purchase expensive equipment, or
even work on personal Projects and inventions.
HANDING OUT REWARDS
There are a few guidelines to follow when you reward Player Characters, regardless of
how they obtained it. Strictly speaking, you have to worry about two things:
 The highest Player Character level in your group. Most of the time, all characters will
be of the same level — but some optional rules can change this.
 The number of Player Characters in your group.
You can then use the table below to "build" an appropriate reward. The table indicates
the average value you should be working with (in zenit), but you can go a bit higher
or lower for particularly rich rewards or minor findings; the table also indicates the
suggested maximum value of any single item found at a given level range.
You will find more information about rare items on the next pages.
Highest
PC Level
Maximum
Item Value
Average Reward
2 PCs 3 PCs 4+ PCs
5+ 500 z 500 z 750 z 1000 z
10+ 1000 z 800 z 1200 z 1800 z
20+ 1500 z 1000 z 1500 z 2000 z
30+ 2000 z 1600 z 2400 z 3200 z
40+ any 2000 z 3000 z 4000 z
Example: The average reward for a group of five level 26 characters is 2000 zenit, and
no single item should have a value higher than 1500 zenit.
It is generally better to split the reward budget into a variety of weapons, accessories,
shields, armors, and valuables; avoid spending all of it on a single powerful item or
handing the heroes a huge pile of coins.

GAME MASTER

CHAPTER
REWARD FREQUENCY
On average, the chart is based on the idea that a group will receive approximately one
reward per session (as in, every four or five hours of play). This is not a hard rule and
more of a guideline: there will be some sessions in which characters do not receive
rewards in the form of fancy items, but instead develop connections or retrieve a
powerful artifact. That table is there to help you, not to constrain you.
CREATING INTERESTING REWARDS
Here are a few things you will want to keep in mind when creating rewards:
 Learn what your Players want. If you catch a Player saying they’d like a specific item
for their character, take notes — you can include that item in a future reward.
Consider a Survey or Wishlist, as explained on page 123.
 Items that tell a story. When placing a given item among the rewards found by the
characters, consider what it says about the surrounding area and its inhabitants. Who
brought the crystal rod to this shrine? Why did the ancient wyvern guard a ring with
no apparent value?
 Here and there. When the occasion arises and it doesn't feel forced, split your reward
into smaller mini-rewards tied to different places, creatures, or threats. The Classic
example would be a dungeon with several hidden treasures.
 Foreshadowing. This is a classic in JRPGs, and something you will either love or hate.
What you could do is hand out rewards that will prove useful in future battles, such
as a silver talon (page 272) in a dungeon crawling with undead creatures that are
Vulnerable to its light damage.
Adopting this method will surely make your sessions feel more “videogamey”, but it's
a matter of taste. Discuss this choice with the rest of your group.
ROGUES AND SOUL STEAL
Player Characters who put levels in the Rogue Class will likely acquire the Soul Steal
Skill, which allows them to extract items from powerful enemies. Items obtained this
way are in addition to normal rewards.
266
W
DESIGNING RARE ITEMS
Over the course of the game, you will often need to come up with a rare item—perhaps
it’s part of a reward, a lost treasure, an arcane weapon extracted from the soul of a
demon or monster, or even a peculiar object sold by a merchant.
In such instances, you may:
 Choose an existing Rare Item. This is the simplest solution! Pick one of the sample
items presented in this section. Make sure to choose something appropriate to the
situation, such as a mjolnir hammer for a storm demon.
 Create a new Rare Item. Follow the guidelines presented in this section to create a
new rare item. Sometimes you can take an existing item and simply change the type
of damage it deals, or have it grant a different bonus, but it's encouraged that you try
to come up with items that resonate with how and where they were found.
Rare items can and should tell their own story!
BE CAREFUL WITH BONUSES
Items that grant a bonus to a specific type of Check, as well as items that grant an
increase to Defense or Magic Defense, are especially powerful: that is because Fabula
Ultima features a relatively "flat" math progression when it comes to Checks.
Even an innocuous-looking +1 bonus can make a huge difference; because of this,
avoid granting characters too many rare items whose special abilities enhance
Accuracy Checks, Magic Checks, Defense or Magic Defense.
In general, a character should not be given the opportunity to equip more than two
such items at any given time. Feel free to give out more, but make sure these are
mutually exclusive options: should you equip the Crested Helm that gives a +1 bonus
to Accuracy Checks, or the Pointy Yellow Hat that gives a +1 bonus to Magic Checks?
AVOID COPYING EXISTING SPELLS OR SKILLS
When you create a Quality for a rare item, try to avoid copying the effects of a Skill
or spell that is unique to a specific Class. Instead, look at which Skills the Player
Characters have acquired and give them items that synergize well with those, or that
provide useful (if pricey) alternatives when those same Skills would otherwise be
ineffective.

WHAT TO DO IF YOU MESSED UP
If you realize an item is much stronger than you had anticipated, do not worry. Resist
the temptation to take the item away from the group; you should also avoid simply
making the item useless by creating situations in which it never makes a difference.
Instead, talk with the Players and explain what you did wrong, then adjust the effects
of the item together.
With this optional rule, Player Characters may pay a
blacksmith or artisan to add a Quality to armor, shields,
or weapons that doesn't have one, or to replace an item's
Quality with a different one (remember, an item can only have
one Quality).
The Player selects a Quality from the default list for that item type as long as
the cost modifier associated with that ability is +1000 zenit or lower. Then,
the character must spend an amount of zenit equal to twice the cost modifier
associated with the chosen ability: once this is done, the process generally takes
one day per item. Multiple characters may of course pool their money together to
purchase the more expensive abilities.
Example: To replace a weapon's current Quality with Multi (page 269),
you must spend 2000 zenit. To replace it with Resistance, you must
spend 1400 zenit.
The default list of weapon abilities can be found on page 269, while the default
list of armor and shield abilities can be found on page 280.
If a Player Character acquires the Upgrade Heroic Skill (page 237), they
will gain access to this optional rule by default.
OPTIONAL: BUYING QUALITIES

DESIGNING RARE WEAPONS
Weapons are the most complex rare items to design — but this also makes them one
of the more unique and satisfying rewards to give!
OW Choose an existing basic weapon from the list on pages 130 and 131 —ignore
the unarmed strike, improvised (melee), and improvised (ranged) weapons.
1
OW
By default, weapons deal physical damage. If you want your weapon to deal
damage of another type (air, bolt, dark, earth, fire, ice, light, poison), increase
its cost by 100 zenit.
2
OW
Finally, you may give the weapon a single Quality chosen from the list on the
right or use the sample abilities as a guideline to come up with a custom effect.
This increases the final cost of the item by a variable amount.
4
OW
You may apply any of the following changes:
 If the weapon is a two-handed weapon, you may turn it into a one-handed
weapon. If you do, reduce its damage by 4.
 If the weapon is a one-handed weapon and it does not belong to the
brawling, dagger, or thrown categories, you may turn it into a two-handed
weapon. If you do, increase its damage by 4.
 You may add a +1 bonus to the weapon's Accuracy Check. If you do, increase
its cost by 100 zenit. You cannot add this bonus if the weapon already
grants a bonus of +1 or higher to Accuracy Checks.
 You may increase the weapon's damage by 4. If you do, increase its cost
by 200 zenit.
 You may modify the Attributes required by the Accuracy Check, but tread
carefully: much of a weapon Category's "feel" and balance comes from the
Attributes it relies on. Accuracy Checks relying on a single Attribute are
worth 50 more zenit than those relying on two different Attributes.
3
If a weapon has a final damage modifier of +10 or higher, that weapon automatically
becomes a martial weapon (E).

ARTIFACTS
While rare items allow you to customize your character, artifacts are the objects your
entire campaign will revolve around. They don’t just grant you a bonus to Checks,
improved damage or a way to ignore status effects: no, artifacts are so powerful that
they draw the attention of the major factions in your world.
Artifacts cannot be sold or purchased, except for truly ludicrous prices — and even
then, there aren’t many who are willing to part with such powerful objects.
ARTIFACTS IN YOUR GAME
There are no rules for designing an artifact: its fantastic effects should go way beyond
those of typical spells and magical items, and are only limited by what you as the
Game Master think would be appropriate. Needless to say, you can’t have a new
artifact pop up every other session — each story arc should feature one or two at most.
Make sure your artifacts are important elements of the ongoing story at the table, and
not just “super powerful magical toys”.
ASTROSCOPE
A large globe filled with stars and swirling clouds.
Anyone who rests their hand atop this powerful
artifact and gazes upon the swirling energy
within can manipulate the cycle of day and
night within a range of 1 travel day; they
may also modify weather conditions in
the same area (wind, blizzards, snow,
clouds, and so on). This functions
identically to an Entropism (for day
and night) or Elementalism (for
weather conditions) Ritual, but
this artifact does not consume Mind
Points and the user does not need to
have mastered any of the magical
disciplines in question.

BLACK BLOOD
A large vial filled with an oily and sticky black substance.
It is said this liquid was gathered from a tainted spring in the depths of the earth.
Those who drink it gain a peculiar ability: when killed, their spirit will not return to
the stream of souls that permeates the world. Instead, they will retain their conscience
and remain bound to the land of the living.
Why anyone would choose such a fate remains a mystery, however...
DEAD MAN'S ZENIT
It resembles an ancient gold coin, save for the skull on its back.
Easily lost or misplaced, this unassuming gold coin appears worn by age. Many who
see the shining skull on its flip side would laugh it out as a coinsmith's prank, but old
sailors would urge them to let the thing sink to the bottom of the ocean: an old legend
tells of an indestructible golden coin whose bearer may command an army of ghostly
pirates in exchange for their own soul...
FINAL FEATHER
This beautiful feather shines with the colors of the rainbow.
Countless scholars have debated the nature and origin of this forearm-sized feather
but were unable to find an answer. Only two things are certain: it's the last of its kind,
and several legends suggest it can be crushed into a light powder that can resurrect
a recently fallen creature.
Up until now, no one has gathered the courage to put that legend to the test, especially
because it would mean destroying the feather.
HELM OF THOUGHTS
Fashioned from the skull of an unknown beast, this helm is surprisingly light.
Whoever wears this artifact can effortlessly sense the surface thoughts and emotions
of surrounding people. By focusing their attention and using an action, the wearer
can read the thoughts of a specific living creature. While using the dreadful power of
this artifact, the target only feels a faint tingling sensation at the base of their skull,
unaware that their mind is being read.
290
W
ROD OF RISING EARTH
A forearm-sized staff made of brass-like metal.
This powerful artifact comes from an era of lost technology. Its core body is made of a
nigh-indestructible and extremely light metal known as orichalcum, encasing a gem
formed by crystalized earth spirits. When placed in the center of a structure known as
"an orichalcum ring", whose nature and construction is yet unknown, the rod may lift
entire landmasses from the ground and cause them to float and move.
SOULREND
The hyper-sharp edge glows with ominous light...
Resembling the lower portion of a shattered greatsword, this artifact is almost useless
in an actual fight: its true power lies somewhere else. If the correct sequence of stances
and movements are performed, the wielder may isolate a single consciousness present
in the stream of souls and sever it from the flow. This is a Ritualism effect of extreme
potency, made easier if the soul in question belongs to someone who recently passed,
if they were of especially strong character, or if the wielder of Soulrend had a deep
personal bond with them. Depending on the outcome of the Check, the soul might
only be temporarily severed or even become unable to return to the spiritual stream,
doomed to gradually vanish into oblivion or trapped in eternal torment.
TOME OF THE GATE
A hefty grimoire. Sometimes, the crimson eye on its cover seems to move...
The pages of this ancient-looking book are filled with unreadable gibberish and
unsettling pictures, portraying nightmarish creatures in their adoration of the sky.
If bathed in the light of a full moon, the ink begins to glow a reddish hue and rises
from the pages, twisting into a network of writhing tendrils that tear at reality.
This artifact opens a path to the cosmos, which will close at daybreak.

VOICE SHARD
A fist-sized shard of glassy crystal.
It is said that whoever holds this crystal fragment can hear voices whose wisdom
leads to power, wealth and prosperity. Some believe the voices belong to a pantheon
of forgotten deities; others claim they are the voices of wise and generous people that
lived in a past age (or will exist in the future!).
However, the voices can only be heard by the person who grips this artifact... which
means others will have to trust their sincerity.
WAND OF THE WILDS
A tiny, finger-long wooden wand, decorated with emerald leaves.
Too tiny and fragile to be used as a weapon, this precious artifact allows people to turn
into animals. The wielder can use an action to change a willing creature (including
themselves) into a small beast — such as a cat, fish, bird, pup, or squirrel.
Anything carried by the person becomes part of the animal form; while transformed
they cannot speak, fight or use magic. The wand itself, however, can never become part
of a transformed character’s equipment... if you turn yourself into an animal with it,
you’ll have to carry the artifact in your mouth, beak, or talons!
Anyone wielding or carrying the wand can use an action to reverse a creature's
transformation — if the artifact is lost or stolen, the transformation can only be
reversed by a powerful spellcaster (Chimerism discipline, extreme potency).
WINDSCALE
This translucent gold scale is about as wide as a human hand.
It is unclear which creature shed this beautiful scale — but whatever it was, it must
have been a true marvel of nature. Whoever dons this artifact gains the ability to
fly and levitate at will as long as the scale remains in contact with their skin. Some
say that prolonged contact with this artifact may permanently alter the bearer's
physiology, gradually turning them into... who knows what.

W
DESIGNING BATTLES
As the Game Master, your role is to create battles that challenge the Player Characters
and enrich the story. The following pages will provide you with a variety of tools
and guidelines that will help with the mechanical side — but first, there are a few
important points you should try to remember.
 Relevant battles. A battle takes place when two sides are at odds and resort to
violence in order to achieve their goals. Battles should be meaningful: they should
build upon what previously happened in the story, add new interesting characters or
plot elements and move things forward in some important way.
 People, not numbers. Characters are more than their stats. They have emotions, a
personality, their own lives and goals — when they fight, they do so for a reason.
Even the ones that aren't the focus of your story should be treated as more than
disposable, faceless pawns.
 More than the sum of its parts. There are a variety of elements that can alter the
threat posed by a situation — the options available to Player Characters, for instance,
or the particular synergy between two monsters. Once you add the environment, the
whim of the dice and the occasional use of Ritual magic into the mix, you can see that
there is no way to foresee the outcome of a battle — and that’s okay.
Being the GM has nothing to do with being “in control”, but rather with your ability
to react to unexpected situations. Battles are just like that — sometimes, things will
get weird, or the heroes will steamroll their foe. Don’t sweat it too much.
 Balance. While the advice in the coming pages is geared towards building a somewhat
balanced challenge, remember that there’s nothing wrong with an easy battle every
once in a while, or the occasional super-hard boss fight. Just don’t make those the
norm, or they'll lose their charm!
More importantly, respect the Players' expectations and what you discussed during
session zero (see page 147), and design battles in accordance with what you agreed
upon in terms of challenge and complexity.
 Take your time. When the heroes decide to fight an enemy for which you don’t have
any combat stats ready, it’s perfectly okay to pause the game and take your time to
design those creatures. The rules on page 302 have been designed specifically to
make this process as smooth and fast as possible; once you have familiarized yourself
with them, creating new adversaries will only take a few minutes.
And there’s always the Bestiary, of course!

CHAPTER
HOW MANY BATTLES?
In Fabula Ultima, battles will often take a heavy toll on the characters' resources. On
average, a group of Player Characters can face any one of the following before needing
to rest or recharge Inventory Points:
 Three easy battles.
 Two normal battles, or one normal battle and one easy battle.
 One hard battle.
See the next page for easy, normal, and hard battles.
PARTY LEVEL AND ENEMY LEVELS
When designing a battle, you should start by considering which Player Characters are
present on the scene and calculating their Party Level.
The Party Level is equal to the highest character level among the Player Characters
that will take part in the battle. For instance, a group that includes two level 10 PCs
and one level 12 PC will have a Party Level of 12.
Since a character’s ability to deal and withstand damage generally increases with their
level, this number allows you to gauge the danger presented by enemies, whether you
found them in the bestiary or created them yourself.
If an enemy's level is... Then that enemy...
Lower than the Party Level is probably too weak
Within 5 levels of the Party Level should make for an easy fight
Within 10 levels of the Party Level should make for a challenging fight
Greater than the Party Level by 11+ is probably too strong
The creature profiles in the Bestiary (page 319) are organized in five-level increments,
which should give a good range of enemies for your battles.
294
W
CREATURE RANKS
Adversaries in Fabula Ultima may be soldiers, elites, or champions.
d SOLDIERS
A soldier-rank foe is roughly on par with a Player Character of its level. Creatures
in the Bestiary are all soldiers — for instance, a level 15 Cactroll (page 348) would
approximately be as strong as a level 15 Player Character.
Creatures designed following the rules found on page 302 are also soldiers.
The basic assumption is that, when putting together a battle, you should involve a
number of enemy soldiers based on the following guidelines:
Challenge Number of Soldiers
Easy Battle Equal to the number of Player Characters minus one.
Normal Battle Equal to the number of Player Characters.
Hard Battle Equal to the number of Player Characters plus one.
If the PCs are accompanied by helpful NPCs who get their own full turn during the
conflict, each of these allies should be counted as an additional Player Character.
To spice things up, soldiers can be strengthened into elites and champions.
4
GAME MASTER
295
W
CHAPTER
d CREATING AN ELITE
Elite creatures count as two soldiers of the same level.
If you want to turn a soldier into an elite, do the following:
 Hit Points: Double the creature's maximum Hit Points.
 Skills: The creature gains one Skill of your choice. This may be an NPC Skill (see page
306) or a Skill taken from a character Class.
 Turns: During conflict scenes, an elite performs two turns per round.
 Initiative: The creature increases their Initiative score by 2 points.
d CREATING A CHAMPION
Champion creatures can replace any number of soldiers of the same level.
If you want to turn a soldier into a champion, do the following:
 Hit Points: Multiply the creature's maximum Hit Points by the number of soldiers
they are replacing.
 Mind Points: Double the creature's maximum Mind Points.
 Skills: The creature gains a number of additional Skills of your choice equal to the
number of soldiers replaced. These may be NPC Skills (see page 306) or Skills taken
from a character Class.
 Turns: During conflict scenes, a champion performs a number of turns per round
equal to the number of soldiers they are replacing.
 Initiative: The creature increases their Initiative score by 1 point for every soldier
they are replacing.
Remember that while elites and champions can perform more than one turn per
round, they must still do so while alternating with the Player Characters — that is,
they will not perform back-to-back turns if at least one Player Character has yet to act
during the round.
The Petrified Woods are the Great Behemoth's hunting grounds.
And yet, some who encountered it were strangely spared.
296
W
LEVELS AND RANKS
Use levels and ranks as "sliders" to adjust the challenge posed by a battle.
Example: When designing a battle involving three level 10 Player Characters, two
level 10 soldiers would make for an extremely easy encounter, while a level 20
champion replacing four soldiers would be feasible but particularly challenging.
Anything between those two extremes would be fair game — with a battle against
three level 15 soldiers being the most “average” option.
IDEAL LENGTH
In Fabula Ultima, a conflict should ideally last three to four rounds. Keep this in mind
when you design your battles.
If you want to think in terms of damage, this means that on average, a successful
enemy attack should do damage equal to one third of an average Player Character's
Hit Points. Similarly, a PC's average attack should do damage equal to one third of an
average soldier-rank enemy's Hit Points.
DAMAGE TYPES
When designing a battle, consider what types of damage the group has access to:
 Combine adversaries with different Vulnerabilities and Resistances.
 Grant powerful adversaries the ability to alter their Vulnerabilities and Resistances.
 If a creature has a Vulnerability that two or more characters in the group can exploit,
balance this out by enhancing their Defense, Magic Defense, or Hit Points.
 If a creature has a large amount of Hit Points (as champions often do), give them at
least one Vulnerability that the party can use to their advantage.
Make it so that Player Characters cannot simply apply the same highest-damage
option over and over during battles — that can get boring fast.
4
GAME MASTER
297
W
CHAPTER
INFORMATION AND HINTS
Even if the heroes face a powerful foe, it is incredibly important for the battle to be
transparent. It is your job as GM to communicate the following clearly:
 Crisis. Always make sure to tell the Players if an enemy is in Crisis, and give hints if
this caused it to gain new abilities or change its damage Affinities.
 Damage Affinities. If a creature takes damage, tell the Players what the corresponding
Affinity is — Vulnerable, Resistant, and so on. Inform the Players again if they use the
same damage type and the creature's Affinity has changed.
 Changes in attacks and abilities. When a creature uses an ability, if its effects have
changed during the scene, make sure the Players know.
 "Charged attacks". If an enemy is about to use a powerful attack — the kind that the
Player Characters should Guard against! — you should describe them charging their
energy at the start of the round, and only unleash the attack later so that the group
can prepare for it.
Always allow the group to make informed tactical choices.
RANDOM TARGETING
This is the default method of choosing targets in Fabula Ultima, and it frees you from
the responsibility of picking targets for enemy attacks. Simply assign a number to each
member of the Player Character's side, and determine the targets of attacks, spells and
Skills by rolling dice.
SWARMS
If the Player Characters find themselves battling a great number of identical creatures
and you want them to feel powerful, treat all those creatures as a single swarm.
Examples of swarms may be a horde of drooling zombies, a cloud of deadly insects, or
even an entire unit of trained magitech gunners.
If you want to turn a creature into a swarm, just do it — mechanically the creature
will be the same, it is simply “described” as a multitude of smaller beings within the
narrative of the scene.
298
W
OBSTACLES AND GIMMICKS
You may add extra complexity to your battles by including:
 Defenders. Some creatures might completely shield an ally from attacks; characters
must either defeat these defenders or find a way to circumvent them (probably
through a Clock of some kind, generally eight to ten sections).
 Limited options. Some adversaries might only be susceptible to specific actions until
the heroes manage to alter the situation in some way.
 Gimmicks. Some battles might require characters to perform actions in a certain
order or use specific damage types to disable their enemies' most powerful attacks.
For instance, a golem might be unable to unleash its lightning beam if struck by bolt
damage while charging its elemental coils.
 Waves. This is a common situation in video games. Each wave consists of a group of
about three to five enemies; defeating one wave causes the following wave to arrive
on the scene, turning the battle into a war of attrition. If you want to make things
easier for the Player Characters, give them a round to regroup and recover between
each of the waves.
 Reinforcements. You might have new enemies join the battle at the end of each
round. These enemies should have simple attacks and be relatively easy to defeat.
You should establish a limit beyond which no new enemies will be added to the scene
until some have been defeated.
Regardless of which options you choose, you should design battles to challenge the
heroes' ability to work as a team: don't shut down any of their Skills completely, but
rather push them towards experimenting with what their characters can do in ways
that are different from the strategies they previously adopted.

GAME MASTER

CHAPTER
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
Any battle can be made more interesting by adding environmental effects. You should
try to introduce such features after one or two sessions to grow familiar with the
combat rules before experimenting with them!
Here are some examples of environmental effects; the damage they deal should be
based on the table on page 93.
d ELEMENTAL AURA
This effect grants all creatures a Resistance or Vulnerability to a specific type of
damage (such as a cursed cathedral granting everyone Resistance to light damage, or
ocean water granting Resistance to fire but Vulnerability to bolt).
d RISING DANGER
This effects adds one or more elements of increasing danger to the scene; perhaps the
site of the battle is cursed and causes a new penalty at the end of each round (such
as MP loss, a status effect, or direct HP loss). This puts a timer on the battle and forces
the heroes to take risks in order to defeat the enemy quickly.
d TRAPS AND HAZARDS
A natural danger or a mechanical contraption might deal damage to some creatures
at the end of each round, or to any character that performs a specific action. Typical
examples are poisonous fogs, lightning storms, or magical anomalies.
d UNSTABLE AREA
The battlefield might react to specific actions, dealing damage to all participants
or to randomly selected characters. For instance, explosive barrels might detonate
whenever a fire-based spell is cast or a fire-based attack is performed.
When you introduce an environmental effect, you should allow Player Characters to
find ways to disable it or turn its effects against their adversaries. This will normally
require filling a Clock through the Objective action.
300
W
BOSS BATTLES
Battles against powerful bosses are probably the most iconic element of the JRPG
games Fabula Ultima draws inspiration from.
d CHALLENGING
Most boss battles should be hard, thus involving soldiers equal to the number of
Player Characters plus one, or any equivalent combination of soldiers, champions,
and elites. You can always opt for a single champion that tackles the entire group of
heroes all at once — maybe a colossal creature such as a dragon or a massive robot!
d ULTIMA POINTS
Any foe worthy of being considered a boss should probably be treated at least as a
minor Villain and given a pool of Ultima Points (see page 101).
d MULTIPLE PARTS
This type of battle always works well! Create a boss whose “main body” is an elite or
champion enemy, and whose “limbs” are soldiers. You might also give the main body
the ability to regenerate destroyed limbs by spending an Ultima Point!
Example: A giant crab enemy with a central body (champion 2) and two pincers
(soldiers) can be an interesting fight for a group of three heroes.
Another nice touch is to have these limbs engage the heroes in different ways, with
"defensive limbs" blocking the path to the creature's main body and "magic limbs" that
can cast offensive and defensive spells.
Back to the previous example: The massive right pincer has lots of Hit Points and can
use the Guardian's Protect Skill (page 197). The left pincer is encrusted with jewels
and can cast ice and lightning spells.
The advantage of multi-part bosses is that Player Characters can approach the battle
in different ways and get a tangible sense of progress as they slowly but surely reduce
the enemy's effectiveness by destroying or blocking different limbs.
4
GAME MASTER
301
W
CHAPTER
d MULTIPLE PHASES
You might design a boss fight where the main enemy, once reduced to 0 Hit Points,
transforms into a more powerful version that is a completely new creature, with its Hit
Points and Mind Points fully restored.
The creature will only be considered "defeated" (and thus choose between escaping
and surrendering) once all phases have been reduced to 0 Hit Points.
When you design a battle with multiple phases, the first one should be more of a warmup
(generally a normal or even easy challenge) and the “true” fight should only begin
once the villain has transformed. If you want to go for the ultimate challenge, you
could build a three-phase battle that goes from easy to normal and then culminates
with a hard fight!
If you do this, it can be a good idea to give the heroes a free round of actions to
prepare themselves between one phase and the other.
Just be mindful that a multi-phase battle can take a long time — plan accordingly and
make sure you have time for it during the session!
d ROUTINES
You can give the boss battle a routine: the creatures perform actions in the same
order, round after round. This option makes the battle slightly easier to manage as
the Game Master, while also making it feel very videogame-y.
It's not for everyone, but it can be an interesting solution to experiment with.
d BE PREPARED
One final piece of advice: since crafting an interesting and challenging boss fight can
take up to half an hour of work, prepare stats for your Villains and potential bosses
in advance.
Updating an enemy to match the level of your group is much quicker than having to
come up with the whole battle on the spot.
"This world has failed me one too many times. I shall
bring forth a new reality, free from the likes of you and me!"
302
W
DESIGNING NPCs
While running the game, you will sometimes find yourself in need of an NPC whose
statistics aren't already provided by the bestiary.
When this happens, you have two possible choices:
 Reskin. The process known as “reskinning” consists of taking an NPC of the appropriate
level and simply describing them as something different, with minor modifications.
For instance, if you need a dragon for your session but your group is level 9, you
could use a drake (which is level 10) and grant it the ability to fly since the rest of the
monster's profile is already fitting.
 Create from scratch. The alternative is to build your own NPC. This process normally
takes ten to fifteen minutes, and possibly longer at high levels.
Over the course of this section, you will learn how to build a soldier-rank NPC from
scratch; please keep in mind that, while this system gives you clear guidelines, the
challenge posed by a given NPC will vary greatly depending on the Player Characters'
Skills, equipment, and current resources!
OW
Think about the NPC's role in the world and pick four Traits that make them
unique: a personality, a need or instinct, or even a specific quirk of their nature.
Much like a Player Character's Identity, Theme and Origin, an NPC's Traits help
you portray them as a three-dimensional being.
Villains may also invoke their Traits to reroll Checks (page 46).
1
OW
Distribute one of the following arrays among the NPC's Attributes.
 Jack of All Trades: d8, d8, d8, d8  Standard: d10, d8, d8, d6
 Specialized: d10, d10, d6, d6  Super Specialized: d12, d8, d6, d6
Upon reaching levels 20, 40, and 60, the NPC chooses one of its Attributes and
increases it by one die size (to a maximum of d12).
4
2 Choose the NPC's level, from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 60.
OW
Choose the NPC’s Species: beast, construct, demon, elemental, humanoid,

W The NPC may have any number of basic attacks — these can be melee ($) or
ranged (a). Basic attacks start with the following profile:
(Attack Name) w【 Attribute + Attribute】 w【 HR + 5】 (type) damage.
The Accuracy Checks for these attacks may rely on any Attributes you choose,
such as【 INS + WLP】 or【 MIG + MIG】, and you are free to choose whatever
damage type seems more appropriate.
Basic attacks may also be modified by Skills (see below); if an NPC can equip
weapons, these too will count among the creature's basic attacks.

W Choose the NPC’s Skills. Each NPC receives a basic number of free Skills based
on their Species (see next page), plus:
 They gain an additional Skill every ten levels.
 They may gain any number of extra Skills by taking an equal number of
Vulnerabilities. Vulnerability to physical damage grants two Skills.
Skills may be NPC Skills (page 306) or come from character Classes.

OW NPCs gain a bonus to Accuracy Checks and Magic Checks equal to【 their level,
divided by ten and rounded down to a minimum of 0】.
Furthermore, all NPCs that are level 20 or higher deal 5 extra damage with their

NPC SPECIES
An NPC must belong to one of the following eight Species.
BEAST Starting Skills: 4
Beasts are feral creatures with animal intelligence. While their shape
is sometimes twisted by magic, they generally do not use spells.
Examples: Giant rat, sun bear, warrior ant.
Rules Beasts cannot acquire the Use Equipment Skill.
CONSTRUCT Starting Skills: 2
Constructs are artificial beings animated by the power of souls, often
crafted by alchemists, mages, or scientists.
Examples: Gargoyle, golem, magitech soldier.
Rules Constructs are Immune to poison damage, Resistant to earth damage, and
immune to poisoned.

HUMANOID Starting Skills: 3
This is a broad category, a catch-all term for intelligent creatures who
tend to live in communities and rely on tools and equipment.
Examples: Bandit, kobold, ogre.
Rules Humanoids always gain the Use Equipment Skill for free.
MONSTER Starting Skills: 4
Monsters are magical beasts, generally quite intelligent and gifted
with supernatural powers. Their features are often bizarre.
Examples: Basilisk, dragon, mimic.
Rules Monsters have no special rules.
PLANT Starting Skills: 3
Far from being typical vegetation, these plants have evolved into
dangerous predators due to mutation or magical influence.
Examples: Alraune, dragontrap, treant.
Rules Plants are immune to dazed, shaken and enraged, and Vulnerable to
(choose one: air, bolt, fire, ice) damage.
UNDEAD Starting Skills: 2
Undead may be corpses reanimated through magic or restless spirits
unable to peacefully return to the stream of souls that forms creation.
Examples: Mummy, skeleton, zombie.
Rules Undead are Immune to dark and poison damage, immune to poisoned, and
Vulnerable to light damage.
Additionally, when an effect (such as an Arcanum, a potion or a spell) would
cause an undead creature to recover Hit Points, whoever controls that effect
may instead have the undead lose half as many Hit Points.
Rising from the Dark Side of the Moon is the
Tower of Orichalcum, where the first monster was born.

NPC SKILLS
What follows is a list of common NPC Skills. You are encouraged to create your own
custom Skills, using these as a guideline.
Remember that your goal when designing a Non-Player Character is to provide
a memorable encounter and an interesting challenge. Keep the PC’s strengths and
weaknesses in mind, and make sure to create synergies between the NPC’s attacks
and abilities!
Each Skill can be taken more than once, with the exception of Skills marked as limited.
That said, you are encouraged to go for variety whenever possible.
CRISIS EFFECT
As long as they are in Crisis, your creature gains a special benefit or ability.
Examples are:
 Your NPC's damage Affinities change.
 Damage dealt by your NPC ignores Resistances (or maybe even Immunities).
 One or more of your NPC's attacks gain multi (2).
Since this Skill will only activate when the creature is already severely damaged, it's
okay for the effects to be quite strong.
DAMAGE ABSORPTION
Choose any one damage type your NPC is already Resistant or Immune to: they gain
Absorption towards the chosen damage type.
This Skill is perfect for elemental creatures that may grow stronger when struck by
attacks matching their element and should generally be accompanied by one or two
Vulnerabilities that can be exploited by clever Player Characters.
DAMAGE IMMUNITY
Your NPC gains Immunity to one damage type of your choice they were not Vulnerable
to. Be careful when making a creature Immune to physical damage since it’s the most
common damage type during the early levels.

GAME MASTER
307
W
CHAPTER
DAMAGE RESISTANCE
Your NPC gains Resistance to two damage types of your choice. If you choose a type
the NPC was Vulnerable to, they don't become Resistant to it: instead, they simply lose
the corresponding Vulnerability (only Vulnerabilities caused by the NPC's Species can
be removed this way).
FINAL ACT (LIMITED)
When reduced to 0 HP, your NPC can immediately perform some sort of special action
or attack. Self-destructing robots and exploding fire elementals are great classics.
Take some liberty with this Skill, making it powerful but also a hindrance for the NPC’s
allies. If this Skill deals damage, it should be minor (see page 93).
FLYING (LIMITED)
Your NPC has the ability to fly or levitate. In addition to the obvious advantage in
mobility, your NPC's melee attacks can target flying creatures and your NPC cannot
be targeted by melee attacks unless the attacker is flying or is somehow able to reach
flying targets.
If the NPC suffers damage of a type they are Vulnerable to, they are immediately
forced to land and lose the benefits of this Skill until the end of the round, when they
will automatically resume flight. Your NPC may also be forced to land by spending an
opportunity.
As long as it is in Crisis, the NPC loses all benefits granted by this Skill.
IMPROVED DAMAGE
Choose one of your NPC's attacks or spells: it now deals 5 extra damage. If you acquire
this Skill multiple times, you must always apply it to a different source of damage.
Be careful when using this Skill to increase damage dealt by attacks with multi.
IMPROVED DEFENSES
Choose one option:
 Your NPC gains a +2 bonus to Defense and a +1 bonus to Magic Defense.
 Your NPC gains a +1 bonus to Defense and a +2 bonus to Magic Defense.
This Skill can be taken only twice, and its effects are cumulative with those granted by
equipment and other Skills.
308
W
IMPROVED HIT POINTS
Your NPC's maximum Hit Points are increased by 10.
This Skill is excellent for creatures that need to compensate for low defenses or
damage Vulnerabilities.
IMPROVED INITIATIVE (LIMITED)
Your NPC gains a +4 bonus to their Initiative score.
REACTION
Your NPC reacts to a specific trigger (such as being missed by an attack, or hit by an
offensive spell). Examples are:
 Performs an attack after being missed by a melee attack.
 Deals minor damage when hit by an offensive spell.
 Recovers some Mind Points when damaged.
SPECIAL ATTACK
Choose one of your NPC's attacks and add a special effect. Examples are:
 The attack gains multi (2).
 The attack targets Magic Defense instead of Defense.
 The target suffers a status effect.
 The target is trapped, swallowed or captured. Breaking free will likely require
filling a Clock of variable size — generally four to six sections.
 The attack deals more damage to targets suffering from status effects.
 The attack allows your NPC to recover HP equal to half the HP loss it causes.
 If the target was dazed or shaken, your NPC controls the target's next action.
 It the target was slow or weak, the attack petrifies them.
 The attack prevents the target from performing a specific action on their next turn.
 The attack grants your creature some kind of bonus that lasts until their next turn.
Some effects are much more powerful than others. When you choose an effect for
this Skill, compare it with other creatures of a similar level in the Bestiary. Take into
account how effective the attack will be in this particular situation as well.

SPECIALIZED
Choose one option:
 Your NPC gains a +3 bonus to all Accuracy Checks.
 Your NPC gains a +3 bonus to all Magic Checks.
 Your NPC gains a +3 bonus to Opposed Checks in a specific context.
This Skill can be taken up to three times, but never for the same type of Check.
SPELLCASTER
Choose one option:
 Your NPC learns one spell and increases their maximum Mind Points by 10.
 Your NPC learns two spells.
NPCs may learn spells from Classes or from the list of NPC Spells on the next page.
Offensive (r) spells cast by NPCs may use【 MIG + WLP】 or【 INS + WLP】 for the
Magic Check.
STATUS EFFECT IMMUNITY
Your NPC becomes immune to any two status effects of your choice.
UNIQUE ACTION
Your NPC may perform the Skill action to generate a unique effect. Examples are:
 Your NPC's next attack or spell will deal 10 extra damage.
 Your NPC changes "stance", swapping or altering their damage Affinities.
 Your NPC calls for reinforcements (these adversaries should be very weak).
USE EQUIPMENT (LIMITED)
Your NPC gains one accessory slot, one armor slot, one main hand slot, and one
off-hand slot. Soldier enemies should only be equipped with Basic Items; elite and
champion adversaries, on the other hand, should often use Rare Items. If an NPC loses
a weapon they have equipped, any Skills assigned to the corresponding basic attack
should be transferred to their unarmed strikes.

NPC SPELLS
When you give a Non-Player Character one of these spells, rename it and tweak its
effects to suit your needs — most spells are already customizable, allowing you to
choose between status effects or damage types: you make this choice when designing
your NPC.
For instance, you might give a creature Cursed Breath from the list below, choose ice
damage and the slow status effect and rename it to Frozen Spear.
SPELL MP TARGET DURATION
Area Status 20 Special Instantaneous
Choose any number of creatures you can see: each of them suffers (choose one:

ANGELA, THE FIRE MAGE
In today's session, the group is investigating traces of a mysterious organization
that has been stealing rare magic tomes and gathering "suspicious" ingredients. The
Player Characters have managed to locate one of the group's hideouts, nestled within
the blackened and mossy remains of an old watchtower. Unfortunately, they weren't
exactly subtle in their search, and a nasty surprise awaits them: Angela, one of the
organization's founding members and a capable pyromancer, has been informed of
their arrival and will confront them directly.
This just happened, and the GM asks everyone to give them a few minutes in order
to come up with a suitable battle. IThere isn't much time, so they try to be as fast as
possible while creating something that provides an interesting challenge.
 First of all, the Game Master looks at the Player Characters' levels. Two of them are
level 10, one is level 9, and another is level 11. This means the adversaries should
range from level 10 to level 20, on average.
 Since Angela acts as the biggest threat in this situation, it makes sense for her to be
level 20. She's a humanoid creature, which means she can equip items and gets three
starting Skills, and she is considered a minor Villain, which means she has access to
5 Ultima Points.
The GM also plans on making her an elite or a champion, but for now she will be
built as a soldier.
 Angela is a capable mage with a strong personality, so she is given the following
Traits: ambitious, arrogant, knowledgeable, and ruthless. She will be easily provoked
and stop at nothing to protect the organization's interests, which includes destroying
all evidence in the hideout if given no other choice.
 When it comes to her Attributes, the choice is easy: a d10 in Willpower, and a d8 in
every other Attribute (normally one of her Attributes should be a d6, but Angela is
level 20 and gets to raise one of her Attributes by one die size).
 Close combat won't be Angela's strong suit, but the GM takes into account her
humanoid advantages and equips her with a ferula (page 270), a rare weapon
that boosts her Magic Checks. The GM decides to give her another basic attack that
showcases her frequent use of fire magic; this will be a ranged attack that relies on
【INS + WLP】 and deals 5 fire damage. The attack is named "flame dart".
Since an adversary level 20 or higher deals 5 extra damage with attacks and spells,
Angela's staff will deal a total of【 HR + 7】 damage and her flame dart will deal a
total o【f HR + 10】 damage, making her a bit more dangerous.

CHAPTER
 Now comes the fun part: Skills. Since Angela is level 20 and her Species is humanoid,
she will start with a total of five Skills because she is being built as a soldier. If she
is made an elite or a champion, she'll get a few more.
First, Angela is a mage and that needs to be taken care of. The GM gives her the
Spellcaster Skill. When a character takes that Skill, they can either learn two spells, or
learn one spell and increase their maximum MP by 10. The GM takes the Spellcaster
Skill twice and gives Angela three spells, plus a slight bump to her Mind Points.
But which spells should be chosen? She's a pyromancer and a dark mage, so she
should get something from Elementalist and Entropist — Drain Vigor and Ignis feel
appropriate. When it comes to her third spell, the GM goes with Flare. The idea is that
the heroes will feel threatened by Angela, and a damage spell like this will surely
leave an impression. All three spells also deal 5 extra damage due to Angela being
level 20.
There are three Skills available, so the GM keeps it simple and takes Damage
Resistances against dark and fire damage, then Special Attack twice, making her
"flame dart" target Magic Defense instead of Defense and inflict weak.
314
W
 Since she's level 20, Angela gains a +2 bonus to Accuracy Checks and Magic Checks.
The GM writes that down.
 Finally, Angela is given some physical protection in the form of a sage robe, bringing
her Defense to 9 and her Magic Defense to 10. Her Initiative score will be 6, and her
maximum HP and MP will both be equal to 80.
 Were Angela a soldier-rank adversary, she'd be done. But that isn't the case.
The heroes confront her inside a magical laboratory, so she'll have a few magical
allies to support her; there isn't much time, so the GM relies on a creature already
present in the Bestiary: the arcane lantern (page 328).
Since they don't want to make the battle too overwhelming and there are four Player
Characters in the group, the GM makes Angela an elite accompanied by two arcane
lanterns (renamed as "Angela's arcane lanterns).
 Unfortunately, the Lanterns are only level 5 — a bit too weak. They could be made
level 10, or the GM could do something different. They know the lanterns are rather
easy to dispatch, being Vulnerable to physical damage, so they give Angela a huge
supply and then add an extra effect upon defeat.
They take away the lanterns' Mana Transfer action and replace it with Mana Burst:
when an arcane lantern drops to 0 HP, it shatters in a wave of spiritual energy and
restores 10 Mind Points to all characters present on the scene, be they friends or foes.
When this happens, a new lantern will join the battle at the end of each round (up to
a maximum of three lanterns in the battle at any time).
This creates an interesting dynamic: the Player Characters can focus their actions on
Angela and risk being swarmed by lanterns, or take out the constructs but gradually
restore Angela's MP, giving her the opportunity to cast more spells.
 Finally, Angela is going to be made an elite; this means she will get two turns per round,
she will double her maximum Hit Points (bringing her to a rather resilient 160), and she
will get an additional Skill. She also gets a +2 bonus to her Initiative score.
The GM is pretty happy with the battle as it is, but thinks the extra Skill should reflect
just how determined Angela is to put an end to the heroes' meddling: when she
enters Crisis for the first time, she will channel her magic in an attempt to destroy
the laboratory — this will be represented by a six-section Clock, named "ashes to
ashes", which will automatically increase by 1 at the start of each of Angela's turns.
The Player Characters can of course use the Objective action to turn back this Clock,
but the only way to preserve the evidence in the hideout is to both reduce the Clock
to 0 and defeat Angela or force her to leave the scene.

THE THORNSHARK
Today's session has been rather slow-paced: the heroes spent some time in a port,
gathering information about the nearby islands, and eventually decided to set sail
towards the Silver Monolith, a mysterious structure rising from the depths of the
ocean, seemingly connecting water and sky. They performed a travel roll — rolling a
d10 since they're in the middle of the ocean — and it came up a 10.
The group is in the mood for a classic "random battle", so the Game Master decides
to come up with a dangerous sea encounter: some kind of huge, monstrous beast.
Sometimes you just want a straightforward fight.
 There are two level 9 heroes, which means one needs to be careful — they don't have
a lot of actions and options. Looking at the creatures in the Bestiary, the thornfish
(page 326) catches the GM's eye: it's level 10 and a flying fish, which will make things
interesting since one of the Player Characters is strictly a melee combatant.
 Most of the thornfish's abilities are fine as they are, but the Game Master wants this
to be a Hard battle (thus involving soldiers equal to the number of Player Characters
plus one), and for the creature to be a champion. Since it replaces three soldiers, the
thornfish — actually, let's call this big boy a thornshark — will gain three additional
Skills and some of its stats will be improved.
 When it comes to stats, the thornshark will have three times the Hit Points of a
normal Thornfish (for a total of 150 HP), twice the normal amount of Mind Points, and
will increase its Initiative by 3 points.
 Finally, Skills. The GM wants this creature to threaten both Player Characters with
its weaker attack, ocean jet, so they think about taking Special Attack and giving it
multi (2). This seems a bit excessive, so they instead pick Crisis Effect and have the
Thornshark gain multi when in Crisis. A nasty surprise, but manageable.
The GM decides to make the creature a bit more special. It's a big flying fish and the
heroes are on a boat in the middle of the ocean, so it's given a Unique Action — it can
dive underwater and become immune to normal attacks until the start of its next turn
or until it loses Hit Points. This Skill could be quite frustrating, but one of the Player
Characters is a capable Elementalist and will certainly prove her usefulness here. She
has the bolt-type spell Thunderbolt, which she can use to force the thornshark out of
the water and down on the ship's deck.
Finally, the creature is given Damage Immunity to ice damage — let's hope the Player
Characters spend a turn Studying this big fish and don't waste any of their precious
resources on frost attacks!

CHAPTER
BESTIARY
This final chapter details a variety of NPCs that the Game Master may use as reference
when designing adversaries during the first 20 levels of the game, but further
supplements will add even more — in the meantime, make sure to experiment with
the rules for NPC design (page 302) and come up with unique adversaries!
SPECIES AND LEVELS
This chapter features a section for each NPC Species, in alphabetical order: beasts,
constructs, demons, elementals, humanoids, monsters, plants, and undead.
Within each section, NPCS are listed based on their level, from lowest to highest, in
five-levels increments — level 5, level 10, level 15, level 20, and so on.
All NPCS listed in this chapter are soldiers (not elites or champions).
STUDYING A NON-PLAYER CHARACTER
If you want to know more about an NPC's profile, perform an【 INS + INS】 Open Check
— during a conflict scene, the Study action is what you're looking for.
The Game Master will reveal the corresponding amount of information:
Result You know...
10+ The NPC's Rank, Species, maximum HP, and maximum MP.
13+ All the above, plus Traits, Attributes, Defense, Magic Defense, Affinities.
16+ All the above, plus basic attacks and spells.
The Game Master may apply a +2 bonus or -2 penalty for creatures that are especially
common or hard to find. Once you perform the check, that is what you know — the
same character cannot retry the Check, regardless of if they encounter a different NPC
that would feature the same profile. However, you can still study different aspects of
the creature (such as desires and motivations); if the NPC changes profile, perhaps
through a transformation or a change of phase, they can be studied again.

the desert dunes but become much more active at night.

d 1. NAME, LEVEL AND SPECIES
At the top of the creature profile, you will find the creature's name, their level (ranging
from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 60), and finally their Species.
d 2. DESCRIPTION AND TYPICAL TRAITS
Each profile features a short description of the creature, followed by a list of typical
(but not universal) Traits for that type of creature. The Game Master should always
consider these Traits when portraying the creature or adjudicating the consequences
of actions — a peaceful creature is more likely to listen to reason than an aggressive
one, for instance.
Villains can also spend Ultima Points to invoke Traits and reroll dice (page 101).
d 3. ATTRIBUTES
This line provides you with the creature's main and secondary statistics:
 Dexterity (DEX), Insight (INS), Might (MIG) and Willpower (WLP) are all listed using
the creature's base die size. Status effects and various abilities may temporarily
influence these die sizes.
 HP indicates the creature's maximum Hit Points, followed by their Crisis score.
 MP indicates the creature's maximum Mind Points.
 Init. indicates the creature's Initiative score. This calculation already takes all relevant
bonuses and penalties into account, such as those from armor or Skills.
d 4. DEFENSES
This section lists the creature's defensive statistics:
 Defense (DEF) may be listed as a fixed number (if the creature is wearing martial
armor) or as a bonus to be added to their current Dexterity die size.
 Magic Defense (M.DEF) is always listed as a bonus to be added to the creature's
current Insight die size.
These scores already take into account any benefits granted by shields and Skills.

game, in this order: physical, air, bolt, dark, earth, fire, ice, light, poison.
 An empty field means the creature has no Affinity regarding the damage type in
question.
 VU means the creature is Vulnerable to the damage type in question, thus doubling
the Hit Point loss.
 RS means the creature is Resistant to the damage type in question, thus halving the
Hit Point loss.
 IM means the creature is Immune to the damage type in question, thus negating the
Hit Point loss.
 AB means the creature Absorbs the damage type in question, thus recovering Hit
Points equal to the damage suffered.
For more information on damage and Affinities, see page 92.
d 6. BASIC ATTACKS

(if any) and only take place if the attack was successful unless otherwise noted.

The dragontrap's Dragoneater, on the next page, is a good
example of how complex you can make an attack in this
game, with a custom Clock for keeping track of trapped
characters. Don't do this too often, and when you do, make
sure it's the main gimmick of that battle.
COMPLEX ATTACKS
Additionally, it should be mentioned that effects such as this one requires
additional judgment calls from the Game Master — would a character be able
to see a swallowed ally and target them with a spell, for instance? As the GM,
if you introduce a creature with complex attacks, make sure the group properly
understands what they're up against.

enough to engulf the limbs of an adult dragon. These are, however,
more often used to capture and digest animals and humanoids.

rooted in the ground — you can run away from them, assuming you

Freeing a swallowed target is a four-section Clock; a soldier dragontrap can only have one
creature swallowed at the same time, but an elite or champion dragontrap can hold up to
two creatures in its maws at a time. If a dragontrap has all mouths occupied and swallows a
creature, it must also release one of the creatures it had previously swallowed.
