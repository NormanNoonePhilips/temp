INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
An adventure surpassing your wildest dreams awaits you in the Fabula Ultima Atlas!
This expansion of the Core Rulebook focuses on high (or epic) fantasy, a genre
characterized by ancient mysteries, breathtaking vistas, incredible magic, and mighty
entities who battle each other for control over imaginary worlds that may appear far
removed from our own.
Truth be told, you can see this Atlas as a natural continuation of the Core Rulebook,
since the latter already showcases many examples and situations typical of high
fantasy, due to it being a popular flavor in JRPGs.
Besides offering a brief introduction to our concept of the high fantasy genre, the
Atlas provides advice and game materials for Game Masters and additional rules for
Players, all in three simple chapters:
 The World provides valuable elements for creating high fantasy settings, including
10 archetypal locations you can use as campaign elements or for inspiration, plus a
list of new rare items and artifacts for truly epic adventures.
 The Protagonists introduces 4 new Classes (Chanter, Commander, Dancer, and
Symbolist). It also provides several optional rules (such as Zero Powers) to push your
characters over the top and unlock ever more combinations.
 The Antagonists chapter focuses on 5 Villains – pregenerated Bosses, each more
fearsome than the last – that will put even the most expert Players to the test.
This Atlas doesn’t presume to be seen as a complete guide to high fantasy; the genre
is widespread and takes on countless shades. Instead, this book is closely connected to
its authors’ creative and philosophical inclinations: their goal is to provide advice and
examples from established JRPGs (see page 199), useful both to those well-versed in
this genre, and especially to those who have recently found their way to Fabula Ultima
and JRPGs in general.
Just turn the page to learn more!

WHAT DEFINES FABULA ULTIMA’S HIGH FANTASY?
High fantasy can mean a lot of things, even within the world of JRPGs. In this book, and
in Fabula Ultima more broadly, the term indicates several elements that the authors
feel represent a specific way of building stories and settings.
In brief, we are discussing the authors’ personal visions, which do not claim to be the
absolute truth. Indeed, narrative genres have nebulous boundaries, and it would be
impossible – maybe even irresponsible – to box them in too much.
What follows may help you to better understand the creative vision behind this book!
d BE GOOD TO THE BONE
Your Player Characters in a high fantasy campaign are good to the point of being
idealized. They always hesitate before wounding or killing, consider violence the last
resort, and forgo all forms of opportunism.
One exception is the tortured hero, ready to cross the line when needed. Though the
actions of these character types initially contrast with those of their companions,
eventually the events of the campaign will cause goodness to take root in their
hearts. The entire group is responsible for contributing to this character arc.
d HAVE EXTRAORDINARY TRAITS
High fantasy characters, creatures, objects, and locations always have extraordinary
and extreme traits: a mighty warrior able to smash through the very walls with her
sword, a secret fortress floating above jagged peaks, and so on. In other words, go
over the top!
d WEAR YOUR HEART ON YOUR SLEEVE
In high fantasy campaigns, your characters’ emotions should manifest clearly and
constantly – often without half measures – in their words, actions, choices, clothing,
and the weapons and magic they use in combat. This doesn’t mean playing boilerplate
characters; on the contrary, it means making the most of your screen time and fully
expressing your character’s nature.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER
“Be it shrouded in light or shadow,
a glorious destiny awaits us.”
d DISCOVER A HIDDEN WORLD
An absolute and shocking truth emerges in the second part of a high fantasy
campaign, completely overturning the balance of power. It might be the discovery of
another world, a looming disaster that lies at the heart of your opponents’ actions, or
the dark side of an apparently benevolent institution.
d CHALLENGE DESTINY AND THE DIVINE
High fantasy campaigns often end in an epic battle against an inescapable fate or
immutable reality, which can take the shape of a false god or another entity with
nearly divine powers.
d MAIN REFERENCES
Here are some titles that shaped the artistic vision of this book:
 Bravely Default and Bravely Second feature plotlines that begin traditionally but
later overturn the Player’s expectations of heroes and antagonists, reaching a point
of pure metanarrative subversion.
 Final Fantasy IV starts as the redemption story of a protagonist who has committed
a heinous crime and then continues with a series of explosive and ever more overthe-
top scenes and situations.
 Final Fantasy IX is an excellent example of a group brought together by fate into
an often whimsical story, with some dramatic and spectacular moments, and an
extraordinary and diverse cast for whom magic is crucial. It is also not afraid to
tackle heavier themes such as like death and war.
 Final Fantasy X showcases a setting far removed from a pseudo-medieval European
aesthetic. Its story focuses on summons, the struggle against dogmatism and
prejudice, the need to accept death and change, and the right of future generations
to choose their own fate.
 Tales of Arise is a great inspiration for a campaign focusing on a revolution. It takes
place in a world torn apart by colonialism, where the protagonists must painstakingly
learn to trust one another, and where the horrors of slavery and oppression are
portrayed visibly through the theft and manipulation of life force.

W
On page 14, Fabula Ultima’s Core Rulebook discusses the Eight Pillars that uphold its
entire play experience. This Atlas builds on those elements in its own way.
ANCIENT RUINS AND HARSH LANDS
This pillar really comes to the fore in high fantasy: dense magical forests, ancient
cities buried beneath the sands, haunted castles, and ruins hiding sinister secrets.
Each location is the allegory of an emotion or concept.
The frozen Western Wasteland, dotted with gray ruins that crumble to the touch,
represents magic’s catastrophic costs. The silence and blinding whiteness of the snow
make this place a limbo without end.
A castle with crystal towers stands on the moon’s dark side – the dwelling place of
the last dragon, reachable only with an ancient airship. It symbolizes the search for
solitude and the loss of faith in the world’s people.
An opulent city-cathedral with jagged spires reaching to the sky. Wyvern flocks circle
among the clouds, and bronze sentries silently guard fleets of stairs – all symbols of
the Dragon Church’s military might.
A WORLD IN PERIL
The world hides incredible secrets and powerful magic… but they are not hidden to
all! What you know at the start is often the mere tip of the iceberg – as the campaign
delves deeper into the world’s lore, you may discover that the Villains you faced until
now are simply pawns in a much vaster game.
Commander Cadmus of the royal army plans to convince the king that the movement
of Imperial troops along the border warrants a preemptive assault. Cadmus believes
he will soon become general and has faith in the Light Stone he received from Nileth
the Witch. He is unaware that the jewel will react with the Imperial Shadow Stone,
awakening a dreadful power that will bring chaos to both nations…
Hordes of monsters periodically surge from the dark rifts secretly created by the
Undying Popess to justify the existence of the Unsullied Order and preserve her
power, keeping a terror-stricken world in thrall.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER CLASHING COMMUNITIES
High fantasy stories often begin with wars or great turmoil – the protagonists are
called upon to fight on behalf of a faction or rescue innocent lives. But, sooner or later,
the situation will escalate and become a matter of ideology – freedom versus order,
hope versus desperation, or tolerance versus prejudice.
While the Acheronian Empire attacks the city of Platea, the principality of Kemet
builds walls along their borders. The Xanadu islands, torn by succession wars, will
be the next target of Imperial hunger. Alone, none of these peoples stand a chance
against the Acheronian magitech armies.
For centuries, the realms of Londinium and Gralia have fought over New Babylon,
each monarch wielding claims based on blood ties to the city’s deceased Matriarch.
The airship on which you are traveling is struck down by Gralian fire. The crash
unearths a dire weapon forgotten by time, while the armies send forth their most
ruthless leaders to crush the enemy, with no concern for the local population.
EVERYTHING HAS A SOUL
The stream of souls (see page 72) is crucial to high fantasy settings: it’s the only
thing truly eternal, from which all else came forth and shall one day return. However,
it has no will of its own and can be altered by especially powerful magic and entities,
sometimes with no turning back.
Zephyr is a world of islands that float around a core of thunderclouds – some say the
Everlake can be found there, the source of both magic and life, to which all spirits
return after death. Only those with the blessing of the Church of Nimuë may access
the springs hidden between the isles: water basins where the life-flow condenses in
luminous vapors, allowing contact with the Everlake.
The Astral Drake Midgardsormr, a demon created within the stream of souls by
the peoples’ despair, is now hijacking the stream itself, slowly draining the planet of
its life force. Plants wither, oceans grow still and lifeless, and animals transform into
fierce monsters. Only by finding and awakening the six Elemental Guardians can you
defeat Midgardsormr, but there are also those who profit from the crisis caused by the
Guardians’ long slumber…
10
W
MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY
In high fantasy settings, the connection between magic and technology tends to be
extreme: they are either one and the same – with powerful magitech infantry and ritual
containment circuits – or in open conflict. If the latter is true, magic tends to be an
ancient and lost art, while technology is dangerous and unfeeling. But there may be
exceptions: magic could bring destruction while technology appears more controllable.
Asteride’s vanguard troops use cutting-edge weapons and magitech armor designed to
protect the mage-tacticians from enemy attacks. Conversely, the nearby nation of Dagda
follows the path of martial arts and healing magic, believing that only cowards would
rely on magically enhanced soldiers.
After the tragic Night of Shattered Stars, the Quivira Federation imposed harsh
restrictions on magic, which has become illegal for anyone outside the Crimson Caste.
Things grow more complicated when a rebel group from the vassal realm Olmedia finds
a young star witch, barely alive after escaping the horrors of a secret Quivirian lab…
Either way, both magic and technology reach explosive and visually stunning peaks
in high fantasy tales.
HEROES OF MANY SIZES AND SHAPES
Not only are there no limitations to what a high fantasy hero can be, but you should
make sure these protagonists are over the top:
Albus is a wood elf from the Petrified Forest. He fights using swarms of floating
crystals and unleashes powerful light spells. His antlers flower with countless
blossoms when he casts his most potent spells.
Lydia is a golf champion who landed in this world from another dimension after
touching a shard from a time crystal. The jewel still sparkles on her hand, allowing her
to summon Arcana and use Entropic magic.
Pwih is an unusual blue-colored mellow ooze warrior who can speak and take
humanoid shape. She doesn’t know where her powers come from and has joined a
group of heroes to learn more about humans.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER IT’S ALL ABOUT THE HEROES
In high fantasy, world events are inextricably tied to your heroes. Some of them may
know that from the start, while others will learn with time. Either way, no hero is
part of this tale by mere chance – and if they are, then it will likely be this existance
“outside the boundaries of destiny” that lets them overturn the world’s fate.
The prophecies speak of four heroes who will save the world from the clash between
the Giant of Fire and the Giant of Ice. As foretold, the Mark of the Lily has appeared
on the right hands of the Prince of Alfheim and the Twin Vestals… but also upon those
of a wandering sword master and the Prince’s younger sister!
Run over by a carriage when she was only a child, Valea lost her left eye and leg but
she was saved by the Bandit Princess. The girl grew up to become an accomplished
thief and joined a group of revolutionaries, but she is about to discover that the man
leading the royal army was onboard that fateful carriage, and that the Bandit Princess
was not motivated by altruism alone…
As always, these connections and plot twists may come from the Game Master or from
Players using Fabula Points.
MYSTERY, DISCOVERY, AND GROWTH
In high fantasy campaigns, mysteries are deep, ancient, and shocking – the protagonists’
personal growth happens precisely when dire revelations overturn their understanding
of politics, magic, or spirituality. That’s when your heroes may discover that they have
been aiding the schemes of a supreme Villain for much of their previous adventures!
Kain – the last of an ancient line of priestesses – begins a desperate pilgrimage to
revive the Sacred Flame, risking his life against the monstrous angels that haunt
the wilderness between the city-states. However, what Kain and his escort ignore is
that the Flame demands a terrible sacrifice and that angels were once something
completely different…
By defeating Charybdis, Maelstrom’s monstrous guardian, you have unwittingly
broken the Northern Sigil. This has accelerated Rector Lucretia’s reckless plan
of opening the four cardinal sigils in order to channel the planet’s energy into the
magitech engines of her new dimensional ship.
“It makes no sense! Why? If we are so
alike, why are you surrounded by people ready to
protect you with their lives? Why are you not alone?”
12
W
The following pages discuss some crucial aspects of participating in a high fantasy
campaign with Fabula Ultima.
Since the Core Rulebook is strongly tied to high fantasy, these suggestion are also
appropriate for the vast majority of Fabula Ultima campaigns.
PROTAGONIST SYNDROME
You will often find plots centered on one or two characters when searching JRPGs,
manga, or high fantasy anime for inspiration. These tales are frequently written as
escapist fantasies focusing on a male protagonist – with whom the expected average
audience can identify – plus a romantic interest and a handful of more or less welldefined
sidekicks.
Conversely, in Fabula Ultima, all Player Characters are equally important, which
allows all of you to have an equal share in developing the story. Even PCs with “main
character” Quirks (see page 114), like Ruinbringer or Glorious Fate, should not steal
the spotlight from the other protagonists.
COMPLICATED AND RIGID PLOTS
High fantasy worlds are rife with magic and mystery, and are thus suited for plot
twists and revelations, ancient prophecies, and travel through space and time. These
elements are acceptable in Fabula Ultima, but don’t overdo it – it’s better for twists
to result from Fabula Points or opportunities rather than being part of a dense and
complex web of secrets imagined by the Game Master. The planning should remain
flexible: you don’t need an answer for everything, especially if these answers railroad
the story, limiting Player creativity and damaging play.
DIVINE AND IMMUTABLE POWERS
The people of high fantasy tales often worship a great variety of gods, however, one of
Fabula Ultima’s premises is that even the most formidable entities should be limited
somehow. These beings may have accrued immense power, but they can still be bested
by those with enough courage and loyal allies.
The world changes constantly, and no one is omnipotent nor eternal.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER ARCHETYPES AND STEREOTYPES
High fantasy tales rely on various archetypes, from the noble warrior in exile to the
gloomy witch, who appears intriguing and reserved. These archetypes are useful
when establishing a character’s concept and Traits but they should not become
stereotypes. Try to include unique details, overturning expectations and showing that
the first impressions of your heroes hide complex personalities.
Take special care with the following:
 Archetypes that model real-world peoples and cultures. Avoid stereotypes when
representing cultural elements like religions, customs, and practices. If you want to
build your character based on real-world figures – like exorcists, gladiators, ninja,
pirates, priests, samurai, witches, or vikings – get your information from sources that
do not reduce these people to mere narrative tools or aesthetic. If you use good
quality sources, you will create complex, multifaceted heroes – it’s also a great way
to broaden your horizons.
 Beauty, gender, and clothing stereotypes. Try avoiding or subverting stereotypes
that moralize the body – for example, do not make all heroes young, athletic, and
conventionally attractive while their enemies are grotesque caricatures. Also, pay
attention to harmful tropes related to gender, social relations, or clothing: a maternal
and timid female hero, an aggressive tribal warrior, a cruel and sensual antagonist,
or a perverse and diabolical Villain whose appearance does not conform to the
gendered expectations of the real world we live in.
Creating a fantasy world allows us to let go of our daily burdens. We should embrace
this opportunity without forgetting that the words, images, and symbols we use have
historical and culturally rooted meanings, which will affect those around us.
ONE DIMENSIONAL VILLAINS
You are welcome to give your high fantasy Villains striking appearances and aweinspiring
abilities, but don’t forget to make them multifaceted characters. Likewise,
exploring concepts like “absolute good” or “absolute evil” isn’t especially interesting –
the Game Master should give their Villains believable motivations, turning them into
the protagonists’ proper nemeses.
After all, from great heroes come great Villains, and vice versa!

CHAPTER
THE WORLD
This chapter provides a bird’s eye view of Fabula Ultima’s approach to high fantasy
worlds. Both Players and Game Masters are welcome to read it – it can provide
valuable tools for either role.
The chapter is constructed as follows:
HIGH FANTASY LOCATIONS
This section helps you create high fantasy regions, settlements, and points of interest.
It also provides ten in-depth examples of high fantasy locations, each detailed first as
a narrative archetype, and then as a collection of playable hooks.
CONFLICTS
This section explores high fantasy conflicts from both narrative and rules perspectives.
MAGIC AND RITUALS
This section delves into high fantasy magic, supernatural beings, and how to use these
elements in your campaigns.
TECHNOLOGY
As with magic, this part discusses the role of industry and technology in high fantasy
settings.
RARE ITEMS AND ARTIFACTS
The chapter’s last two sections focus on rare objects and artifacts you might find in a
high fantasy setting. As well as general advice, there are also a number of ready-to-use
item lists.
16
W
HIGH FANTASY LOCATIONS
During World Creation (see the Core Rulebook, page 148), you are usually trying
to envision new regions, towns, or interesting locations. This section first gives
suggestions on the best perspectives to adopt when creating high fantasy places
and then provides ten examples you can use in your campaigns, or draw upon for
inspiration.
ALLEGORICAL PLACES
When you imagine and describe your high fantasy locations, remember that they
should be rife with meaning expressed as mood and spectacle.
 Meaning. High fantasy locations always channel a theme: they embody an emotion,
feeling, or even a historical event. If you can’t connect the place you imagine with one
of the PCs’ Themes, a threat in the setting, or a mystery upon which you want to shed
new light, then that place isn’t relevant to the campaign.
 Mood and spectacle. High fantasy locations always have one or more fantastical
traits – it may be as simple as a crystal tower that bathes its surroundings in light, or
something more complex, such as an airport for flying airships or a network of marble
acqueducts and waterways, where masked gondoleers steer their boats over flowing
magical sands.
In essence, here’s the “double rule” you can apply to each high fantasy location:
If a place is spectacular for its own sake, or if it matters to the story but has little
spectacle, then it still needs some work.
However, remember that the right and responsibility to create, describe, and enrich
locations and areas in interesting ways doesn’t fall on the Game Master alone. For
example, spending a Fabula Point to reveal that the volcanic tunnels you are exploring
are a part of the sunken capital and hide a long-lost Arcanum is precisely the kind of
input Players should provide during play.
W
17
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
CRESCENDO
Building on the previous point, remember that the places and events in high fantasy
campaigns should gradually become more intense, spectacular, and over the top. This
means that when you introduce new places in the story, you and the other Players are
responsible for respecting the campaign’s general narrative rhythm.
In other words, though all places should provide some spectacle, some “archetypes” are
better suited for a campaign’s start, middle, or end. Don’t play all your cards at once.
For example, a lost city guarding ancient magic usually shows up during the second
half of a campaign, while a peaceful village terrorized by a monster works better in
the first half.
But take these indications with a grain of salt – sometimes, subverting some “classic”
expectations makes for a memorable campaign, if done with moderation. Also, try
not to put other participants in rough spots, as they may feel disoriented by sudden
changes in the story or setting.
ELEMENTAL ATTUNEMENT
All high fantasy locations should be attuned to one or more natural or magical
elements which contribute to their mood and themes.
For example, a city-tower of mages and healers could be attuned to air and light,
while the fortress of a clan which follows an ancient warrior tradition might connect
with fire and earth.
These descriptions can influence the kinds of creatures living in the surrounding
region, as well as their abilities, spells, and magical objects.
Back to the example: the magic tower might be home to flocks of elegant herons
and guarded by golems shooting light beams from their chest-eyes. The fortress,
instead, might contain fire elementals and dragonlike creatures ready to aid the
warriors in combat.
18
W
W
A SOURCE OF POWER
All types of high fantasy locations should hold some form of power, either explicit or
hidden. As heroes, you will eventually need to ally with or oppose the power – and
those who wield it.
The power can take many forms: an intimidating military and technological edge, an
ancient Arcanum that awakens to protect a civilization from danger, or an artifact that
opens the way to near-limitless resources.
Naturally, many crave these powers – the role of each location in your campaign will
depend on the advantages it offers the heroes or antagonists.
CONNECTIONS
Each location should relate to two or more factions, threats, or mysteries in your
world. This way, reaching it and interacting with it will bring about significant changes
and consequences. This principle is true even for remote and long-forgotten places:
there’s always a Villain patiently waiting for their coordinates to be revealed!
Connecting each location to the broader scope of your campaign may seem daunting
at first, especially if they were improvised after a travel roll. Don’t worry, all you need
to do is plant some clue about a mystery or a precious resource whose importance
will be revealed later.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
USING THE SAMPLE LOCATIONS
The following pages contain ten complete high fantasy locations, which you can draw
ideas from or place directly in your campaign, both during and after World Creation.
Each location entry is structured as follows:
 At a Glance. This section provides a synopsis of the location: its keywords, the themes
it symbolizes, the terrain around it, and its elemental forces as well as suggestions
for dangers and discoveries in the area.
 Questions for the group. In Fabula Ultima, you shouldn’t introduce elements
disconnected from the group. These questions allow Players to have creative input
and give depth to the location. Usually, the Game Master will ask the questions – and
they should make it a habit of doing so even when introducing locations that do not
come from an Atlas.
 Typical features. This section provides examples of characters and other elements
that can typically be found in this sort of location. Feel free to take these and use
them in other similar locations of your own devising.
 Location. Here you will find suggestions on where to place this type of location, both
geographically and in the campaign’s timeline – towards a campaign’s start or end,
for instance.
 The Villains’ plans. This section provides suggestions on why Villains might be
interested in this or similar locations.
 Story hooks. Lastly, this rich section details a list of points of interest ($), mysteries
(b), and help requests (?), which the Game Master may use in whole or in part
during play.
Both Players and Game Masters alike are welcome to read these sample locations –
they will help the group attune to the high fantasy style, and can provide you with
inspiration when needed.
Regardless, don’t take any of what follows as “canon” or “official” – you have full
authority to modify any of these places as you see fit!

THE STARTING KINGDOM
A serene and prosperous realm stretches along a wide navigable river, surrounded
by ivory walls that project a mighty magical barrier. An elegant castle towers above
shimmering azure waterfalls that dive into the lake at the center of this neverconquered
capital. Some say there is no safer place in the world. Why would anyone
ever leave?
ONIRIA AT A GLANCE
Keywords: adventure, home, longing, nest.
Terrain: fields, hills, marble. Common elements: E i l
Travel roll: d6, d8. Rare elements: a f
Dangers: a dangerous magical beast passes the barrier; people with no apparent

childhood.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
MONDO
d
d TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Starting Kingdom should include at least one of these features:
 An enigmatic leader who cares for the people’s needs.
 An ancient order of knights that defend the realm with magic.
 Secret access to a place long forgotten, perhaps discovered by one of the PCs
during childhood.
 A viewpoint from which one can admire one of its marvels.
d LOCATION
Oniria should be the first location visited by the protagonists and provide the backdrop
for the first few relaxed play sessions. The Starting Realm should feel like a nest,
sheltered from the dangers of the outside world, an idyllic place where life is serene
– if boring! – and a haven the party can return to between adventures to take care of
business… at least until some crisis occurs.
d THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Locations such as Oniria usually follow one of two storylines: either the city is attacked
during the first few sessions by someone who covets its resources or bears some kind
of grudge, or it will become the lair of an important Villain, perhaps due to a coup or
magical catastrophe – it could also be revealed to always have been their base! This
twist usually takes place during the second part of the campaign, and PCs will likely
be unable to immediately deal with the threat, instead regrouping and acting later.
 Which of you were born here? In which district did you spend your youth?
 For those who have not been raised in Oniria, adapting to the Kingdom’s
everyday life isn’t easy. Why is it so?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Oniria into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ FOUNDER’S PLAZA
A grand marble plaza dedicated to the Founding Queen lies at the center of Oniria’s
lake, connected to the city by airy vaulted bridges. There, the Queen’s statue stands
before a great waterfall. What does it hold in its hands?
 The marketplace. Every morning, dozens of stalls fill the plaza as merchants and
vendors from the realm and beyond bustle about. Does any PC know a trusted
merchant? What unusual item has everyone thus far ignored?
 Celebration. Oniria’s most important festival is the Night of Lights: each year, people
from far and wide gather in the plaza for lavish celebrations honoring the Founding
Queen. Where does the festival’s name come from? Which of the Queen’s deeds is
celebrated, and why did the current ruler not attend the ceremony last year?
 The competition. The Contest of Heroes takes place during the festival. What’s it
about? How does one participate? Who is the most exciting or suspicious contestant
this year? And, more importantly, what’s at stake?
 Crime at the plaza. An important item appears to have been stolen. How did the
thieves disappear into the crowd? Have the PCs met them previously? What plans
are in place to capture the culprits?
b THE NEFTI RUINS
Ronan is an old scholar looking for a group willing to delve into the Nefti Ruins,
a mysterious underground complex whose entrance lies hidden behind Oniria’s
waterfall. Ronan believes the Iris Sphere, a legendary globe he covets for his research,
can be found within. He’ll pay a handsome reward for it.
 Unexpected company. Ronan provides help in the form of an enigmatic adventurer
called Sinann. How will she support the group? What is her hidden motivation for
exploring the ruins?

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Witnessing history. The ruins hold ancient writing about Oniria’s grand past. During the
exploration, the Game Master should ask whoever plays a Loremaster to add crucial
historical details to the scene.
 Treasure. The characters might find ancient weapons, dusty potions, or forgotten
tomes. What will they take?
 Sequana. In the center of the ruins, the group might face Sequana, an ancient river
nymph summoned to protect the Iris Sphere. Sequana’s nature makes her Vulnerable
to fire and bolt damage but Immune to ice. She is quick and territorial, absorbs
magical energy in the water, and is capable of casting ice spells. The heroes can free
the nymph using a Ritual to break the bonds that force her to protect this place;
otherwise, defeating her will lead to her death.
 The iridescent sphere. When a PC lays eyes on the Iris Sphere they see a clouded and
shocking vision of Oniria’s past. What is it? Will the PCs deliver the globe to Ronan, or
will they keep it? How will Sinann react?
? THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY
Emmet, a clever merchant, is gaining more influence over the court, claiming to know
the recipe for the ultimate panacea.
 My hands are tied. Kristine, an Onirian Knight, contacts the PCs. Who among them did
she grow up with? Kristine wants to prove Emmet is a fraud, but a noble protects the
merchant, and the knights are powerless without proof.
 Well-guarded. A silent bodyguard, Asher, never leaves Emmet’s side. Why is she so
intimidating? What unusual weapon does she wield?
 Unmasking. What will the characters do? Will they approach Asher, sneak into
Emmet’s villa in search of the panacea, or seek an audience with the noble, hoping
they are not in on the scheme?
 Royal seal. If the characters unmask Emmet and bring him to justice, Kristine might
reward them in the queen’s name, with an ivory whistle that summons fast mounts.
What do the rides look like? How are they connected to an Onirian legend?
“Oniria is a land of dreams. Its waters lull, its walls protect.
This is our home; outside, all is dire.”

The dense forest is shrouded in mystery, a tangle of roads and untrodden paths which
cloud the senses and disorientate travelers. Something dark and terrible lurks in the
heart of Artemis, slowly corrupting the whole forest – strain your ears enough, and you
might just hear the soft whispers of some unknown being…

 A chatty merchant who is eager to share tales of their travels.
 A skilled herbalist living far from society.
 A mysterious plant protected or cursed by magic.
d LOCATION
The group could cross this location briefly during early play sessions but only
experience its lesser dangers. The forest is full of secrets far beyond the capabilities
of inexperienced heroes – they may choose to come back later once they have found
a way to access the more remote areas. Of course, someone might spend a Fabula
Point right away to discover the paths inward – a dangerous choice for sure.
d THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Artemis is ancient and mysterious – few people have any notion of its magic and
secrets. An antagonist might select it as a hiding place or lair as no one would
think of snooping about, and possible disappearances among the locals might
go unnoticed. Moreover, someone scared by the changes in the forest might act
recklessly and decide to take care of the issue once and for all, striking at its roots.

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Artemis into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE HEART OF THE FOREST
The forest is a tangle of colossal plants inhabited by fierce creatures. It guards its
secrets jealously and is willing to taint the group with corruption to hold them off.
Corrupted characters can’t increase their attribute die sizes until they are purified by
Rituals, Projects, or the aid of a skilled NPC.
 The labyrinth. Reaching the heart of the forest requires a six-section Clock. On a
failure, the Game Master may bring in one of the forest’s dangers – poisonous plants,
fierce beasts, etc. – or corrupt a party member.
 The corrupted oak. Looming within Artemis’ darkest depths is an ancient tree rich
with magic and emanating corruption. Herein dwells the arboreal spirit Hathor:
driven by rage and pain, they lash out with the tree’s roots to drain Hit Points, and
with luminous vines that inflict weak or corruption. They are Vulnerable to air and fire
damage, but Absorb light. What might happen if the characters tried to communicate
with Hathor? What was their original form?
 The cocoon. A giant cocoon grows at Hathor’s base: the source of the corruption.
Have any of the PCs seen something like it before? How did it reach this place?
What would happen if it hatched? Or if it were removed or destroyed?
 The sword in the bark. A sword is embedded amid the roots. It can be retrieved –
even during combat – and makes its wielder immune to the weak status. What mark
adorns its hilt? Who once owned the blade?
b THE VERDANT SANCTUARY
Artemis’ greatest secret is the home of a powerful witch. The only way to reach it is by
resisting the forest’s magical illusions and passing a barrier of poisonous thorns that
blocks the way.
 The ward. Those who try to push through the barrier are thrown back and become
poisoned. Perhaps a Ritual, a Project, or one or more cleverly spent Fabula Points
could dispel the thorns, allowing passage.
27
W

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Ancient symbols. The walls of the Sanctuary tell the witch’s tale; the PCs can learn
how she is trying to stop or spread the corruption. Who feels sympathy for her? How
is the witch’s mindset relatively narrow or cruel?
 The Lady of the Forest. She waits at the heart of the Sanctuary – an ancient and
powerful minor Villain who wields the might of Artemis. If any character is corrupted,
they become shaken when meeting her. During conflicts, the witch is Vulnerable
to dark damage but is protected by two Guardian Roots (soldier rank) which are
Vulnerable to air and fire damage. Once these are destroyed, the witch attacks with
Magic Charms that either cause the dazed status or transfer all her loss of Hit Points
to a random PC. Dispelling all the charms requires a six-section Clock.
 Magical secrets. The PCs might discover a rare ingredient for potions or recipes, the
knowledge of a lost symbol (see page 148), or a magical formula – perhaps tied to
the corruption? How does the Forest change upon its Lady’s defeat?
? CURSED MOON
Ancient legends tell of a lycanthrope who stalks the dark forest at night. Beware, for
the creature has a goal: getting rid of any intruders.
 Request. The characters find a cabin at the edge of the forest where a meeting of the
Hunters’ Guild – keen on getting rid of the beast – takes place. Who are the members
of this organization? Is it specific to this place or more widespread? One of the PCs
has faced a similar shapeshifter before. How did they defeat it?
 Moon brew. The lycanthrope will notice the group if they spend more than one night
in Artemis, but perhaps the forest’s herbalist has a potion that can help them out?
 Fenrir. The beast is a lycanthrope with snow-white fur (a minor Villain) who
shapeshifts at night (due to a curse) and is often followed by Grey Howlers. They
are Vulnerable to fire damage but Resistant to air and ice. Upon attacking, they deal
physical damage and inflict weak. Was Fenrir also a victim of the corruption? Once
reduced to 0 Hit Points, the monster returns to a human form. Who are they?
 The guild. If the characters return to the cabin with proof of their fight with Fenrir,
the Hunters’ Guild rewards them richly and offers a token of membership which can
be used in many cities to get discounted food and lodging.
“One cannot learn all the secrets of a place as old as Artemis.
The forest lives, speaks, and often wants us gone.”

THE HIDDEN VILLAGE
To those who see it for the first time, Mirage appears like an illusion in the desert.
When you get closer, you see the outlines of buildings and palaces dug into solid red
rock, crowned by tall towers sculpted from stone. An azure pond gently laps at the
base of the buildings, its surface so crystalline that it reflects the night stars like a
mirror. The life-giving water is closely guarded by the population.

 An ancient ruin with inscriptions that reveal important secrets.
 An artisan who can craft or sell very rare equipment.
 A great source of magical power.
d LOCATION
A hidden place like this should appear in an inhospitable area like a desert, ice waste,
or island lost in the ocean. The heroes might stumble upon it due to rolling a discovery
during a journey, or by spending a Fabula Point to luckily happen upon a settlement
where they can restock their dwindling resources.
d THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
The secrets hidden in places like Mirage can entice any Villain hungry for magical
power and knowledge. Reaching the town before the antagonist might be a great
challenge for the group, but success will earn them a crucial clue which helps them
better understand the Villain’s plans. Conversely, if the Villain gets there first, they
could prepare a warm welcome for the group by bribing some local officials to work
as secret servants and spies.

Is it some form of special knowledge or magic?
 What is the most eccentric building you notice
as you near the town?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Mirage into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE TOWER OF TEN THOUSAND MIRRORS
The Tower of Ten Thousand Mirrors is the tallest building in all of Mirage, shaped in
ancient times out of a colossal spur of reddish rock. Its solemn air provokes the respect
of any onlooker.
 A test of courage. A rite of passage that all villagers must take at least once in life
occurs inside the tower – it might be an excellent chance to gain their favor!
 Tempus fugit. When the group enters the tower, create an eight-section Clock called
“Acceptance” and a four-section one called “Denial”. If the Acceptance Clock is filled,
Xander (see below) appears before the group. If the Denial clock is filled, the PCs are
magically transported to the heart of the desert. Will they ever find their way back to
Mirage? If so, how?
 Reflections from the past. The tower’s internal walls are covered in mirrors. When a
character gazes into one, their Player narrates a past experience where the PC made
mistakes or caused suffering – the other characters see nothing, but all the Players
get to hear the story! Having done so, the Player should explain if the character
is ready to take responsibility for their actions, or if they deny it: this decision fills
one section of the appropriate Clock. Remember that the Player’s goal should be
exploring their PCs’ emotional state and personal growth (or lack thereof).
 Xander. This sand spirit is the tower’s ultimate challenge. He can hide in shadows,
becoming completely invisible, but he fears light. This invisibility can be removed by
filling an eight-section Clock – approaches using water, cold, or light receive a +2
bonus. Xander hurls powerful fire spells but is Vulnerable to ice and light damage.
Who created Xander and the tower? To what end? If he was defeated in the past, how
does he keep reforming?
 The peak. Those who reach the top of the tower earn the approval of Mirage’s people.
By defeating Xander, PCs might find an ancient grimoire holding a crucial clue or
unique spell. Either way, they will also receive a magical mirror-shard, usable as a
special ingredient for Projects or Rituals tied to memory and remembrance.

b THE VOICE OF WATER
Mirage is home to a spring with waters so pure they reflect the night sky perfectly.
Some inhabitants say that on special nights you can hear the voice of their god, who
lives deep within the spring.
 A mysterious call. When spending the night in Mirage, the PCs hear a voice bearing a
request or message. What does it say?
 Murky waters. The spring’s waters have greatly diminished of late, and are
becoming clouded. Nobody knows why. Which character has witnessed a similar
phenomenon before?
 Velaurog. A gargantuan plant (a minor Villain) now inhabits the spring, strangling
it with its roots. The plant Absorbs ice damage and uses the spring to heal HP at the
end of each round, but is Vulnerable to air and bolt damage, which also block its
healing ability. What gave birth to such an abomination? Who among the villagers
hides the truth?
 The nature of divinity. Once purified, the spring is revealed to be the home of an
Arcanum or guardian spirit. The entity gives the PCs an accessory that increases HP
recovery, as a token of gratitude.
? LOST IN THE TUNNELS
Mirage was built on a network of underground tunnels, carved into stone centuries
before the village came to be. Esther, the mayor’s daughter, has broken an ancient
proscription – delving into the tunnels while following the tracks of some unsavory
individuals who she believes are searching for something down there – no one has
heard from her in days.
 Old acquaintance. Has a PC met Esther before? What is she like?
 Tomb raiders. A group of tomb raiders working for a self-proclaimed archeologist,
Lord Chamberlain (a minor Villain), has settled in the tunnels, looking for a precious
artifact. Most of the robbers are actually undead created by Chamberlain himself.
 Buried truths. The tunnels’ walls tell forgotten tales, revealing an incredible truth
about the history of the world. What is it?
 Gratitude. If the PCs bring Esther back to the surface, they win the mayor’s trust and
a rich reward! If they helped Esther’s investigation, the girl might follow the group as
an allied NPC while they are in Mirage.
“The way to Mirage? How should I know – the sands shift without end.
Besides, they say the village only appears for those ready to be lost.”

than they imagined.
d THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
As a place of connection between all creatures, Yiggdrasill is both a threat and
resource for antagonists, so they may try to either destroy or conquer it. Once the
heroes reach the World Tree, the current Villain might already be at work, with their
plan well underway, or they might try to hinder their advance by committing their
first, true villainous act: something so far removed from the PCs’ beliefs that they will
decide to end the threat once and for all.

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Yiggdrasill into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ EDEN, CITY WITHIN BARK
Yiggdrasill’s trunk is vast, and over the centuries, a great and beautiful city has been
built on it, its harmonious buildings made out of stone and wood from fallen branches.
 The council. A council of elders rules Eden, guided by Consul Halcyon. Each member
masters a different type of magic. While they bear no ill intent, they are deeply
suspicious of outside meddling.
 The permit. Visitors can only access Eden’s lower levels – anyone wanting to visit the
Academy or the Light Bridges (see below) needs the council’s special permit. What
is required to receive one?
 Magic school. The Academy is one of Eden’s most noteworthy buildings, home to
some of the most remarkable students of all things magical. It also houses a stunning
collection of mostly uncatalogued ancient grimoires and odd artifacts. Which object
have the PCs heard about? What might entice a Villain to action?
 The door between worlds. Forming a great spiral where the trunk twists before
splitting into branches, the Light Bridges connect Yiggdrasill to many portals
worldwide, some of which have been inactive for a long time. Legends suggest they
might lead as far as the moon or other planets.
b BLUE DESPAIR
Yiggdrasill’s people suffer from a magic illness known as Blue Despair, which causes
people to distrust one another, leading to daily outbursts of anger and aggression.
 Omen. Flocks of colossal Vampire Bats started nesting amid the upper branches
once the leaves began to turn blue. Some swear they spotted a Shadow Howler (Core
Rulebook, page 333) on the prowl, silently watching people, and then vanishing.
Were the group to encounter it, it might show visions of impending doom, somehow
connected to the PCs…

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 The Heart of Yiggdrasill. Feeling the Blue Despair taking hold of her, Consul Halcyon
asks the PCs to bring the Heart of Yiggdrasill to Eden to cure the people with its
miraculous powers. Where is the heart hidden? Why is it hard to reach? How was it
contaminated, and which event made its wounds so deep?
 Betrayal. When the characters return to the village, one of the Consuls might fall prey
to the Blue Despair and begin craving the Heart for themselves. Who is attempting
to talk some sense into this Consul? What will happen if the PCs cannot solve the
situation peacefully?
 Blessing. If the heroes solve these tensions, the Heart heals, and its protective energy
dispels the Blue Despair. They receive a special blessing which protects them from all
status effects for 1d6 days. Moreover, the group will always be welcome at the World
Tree. They even receive a small home there – each Player should describe their room.
? PEOPLE ON THE RUN
One of the Light Bridges that connect Yiggdrasill to distant worlds suddenly activates.
The people of Velim are fleeing from a gruesome war against an unstoppable foe. Now
in dire straits, they seek shelter.
 The Velimians. Moved by prejudices against the Velimians, many people of Yiggdrasill
want the bridge shut down. One of these prejudices is tied to looks. How does the
Velimians’ appearance cause fear and incomprehension? A second prejudice is tied to
their past. What are they sadly remembered for?
 Unusual fears. The PCs immediately notice that the Velimians fear light magic (which
is powerful in Yiggdrasill) to the point of panicking when they witness it. What caused
this fear? Is it tied to the threat they are fleeing from?
 Help us! The Velimian spokesperson, Bryce, seeks the group’s help. What are her
requests? Should the negotiations fail, will she stand by as the bridge to Velim is
sealed to protect Yiggdrasill from the threat beyond? Perhaps the heroes might
suggest a different course of action?
 Rival factions. The council fears the Velimians’ past. However, the son of the Ice
Consul, Arthur, would welcome the refugees. Both factions have their own reasons
and support from the people, so it’s up to the PCs to tip the scales – and public
opinion! – one way or the other. What do the characters think, initially? Who among
them believes it right to influence this outcome, and who disagrees?
“All creatures were born of Yiggdrasill
and will return to it when they die. We are connected.
We ventured from a shared home, sustained by fragile balance.”

Tethys is a great place to transition between the first and second halves of the story

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Tethys into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE EMPRESS
At any point while crossing Tethys, the Player Characters ship might meet an imposing
and ancient-looking galleon with a worn-down hull and torn sails. It seems odd that
it still rides the waves… until one realizes that this is none other than the ghost ship
known as the Empress.
 Troubled nights. If the PCs ignore the grim vessel and do not board it, awful dreams
about its empty halls haunt the rest of their nights in Tethys. The silent galleon will
also follow their ship, disappearing only when close to shore – but reappearing
whenever the heroes set sail.
 A doomed voyage. While exploring the ghost ship, the group will soon encounter
what is left of its crew, now turned into Skeletons. A Skeletal Quartermaster – a
clever elite undead – guards the captain’s cabin. It can summon a new Skeleton to
its aid at the end of each round until there are half as many as the number of PCs. The
Quartermaster wields a mighty anchor still encrusted with sea salt – it inflicts heavy
damage, but on a missed attack it randomly strikes one of the Skeletons instead,
inflicting minor damage to it.
 A final kindness. The PCs find documents detailing the ship’s sad end. Some restless
spirits hiding in the rooms wish to talk to the PCs to unburden their souls. How will
they help the phantoms?
 Memento. Once the group reaches the captain’s quarters, the spirit of the undead
seaman asks them to take a pouch of ash and a Broken Crest across the ocean and
deliver them to someone named Ari. Perhaps one of the heroes has heard this name?
Who is it?
 Old glories. The ship is full of excellent spare parts, armor, and expertly crafted
weapons that once belonged to soldiers from a nearly forgotten realm. What was its
name and coat of arms?

CHAPTER
b THE SUNKEN CITY
The city hides just below the waves, held in place by powerful magic. Little is left but a
few columns and broken edifices reaching for the sky. Still, this nameless city pulsates
with power and shines with a rainbow of lights.
 Hidden history. The city’s name has been lost, and its statues toppled, but it still
holds deep lore. A past event which the PCs believed in with great certainty turns
out not to be true, and the proof is here to see. What event was it? Which one of the
characters feels their worldview crumbling at the discovery?
 Abandoned. The dread pirate Edwards, captain of the Timoria, abandons all who
question his power at the Sunken City. The survivors are exhausted and suspicious,
but if the group offers passage, they will tell the PCs about a sealed room in the city,
and maybe even reveal one of Scylla’s Vulnerabilities (see below).
 Song of Remembrance. If the PCs break the seal, they reach the small temple of an
unknown sea god. Upon the altar lies a parchment bearing the Song of Remembrance,
a spell believed to counter any curse. Once used, the parchment crumbles to dust.
? THE GODDESSES’ ENVY
Long ago, an envious goddess transformed a young woman named Scylla into a
monster. The fiend still roams the ocean, ambushing ships.
 Ten tolls. Scylla has a ten-section Clock that fills up by one at the end of each round.
Upon the ringing of the tenth toll, the ocean’s waters swallow the PCs’ ship, causing
their surrender.
 Scylla. A sea fiend with the face of an angel (a minor Villain) whose howling inflicts
the dazed status effect. She Absorbs ice and Resists dark damage but is Vulnerable to
bolt and fire. Her Tentacles – Vulnerable to light damage but Resistant to ice – inflict
slow on a successful hit.
 Song of despair. Scylla longs for freedom, and her tormented wails could attract the
heroes’ attention. They could lift the curse through an extreme Ritualism or Spiritism
Ritual, or with the Song of Remembrance (see above).
 A monster’s gratitude. If the group helps Scylla, they receive her pendant: an
accessory that makes the wearer Vulnerable to fire and bolt damage but lets them
Absorb ice.

what protects us from the sins of our ancestors.”

THE IMPERIAL CAPITAL
W
This sprawling city has covered the surrounding landscape, forcing it to serve as
its nourishment. From its center rises the Dome, a research center where Imperial
machines are created. The sky looms gray, and there is no way to tell dusk from dawn.
Each day brings in more buildings, and the Imperial Capital seems to constantly grow
and expand as if it were alive.

CHAPTER
d
d TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Imperial Capital should include at least one of these features:
 Clear technological superiority gained through secret experiments.
 An influential and enigmatic person of power, often a Villain.
 A majority that is proud of Imperial conquests.
 Strong environmental impact and aggressive land policies.
d LOCATION
Endir should be a place to resolve plot elements and a crucial destination for the
group. The Imperial Capital is usually home to a faction that opposes the Player
Characters and what they all stand for – it may be the source of many of their troubles,
or the birthplace of one or more Villains. The characters should know about this place
from the early game sessions, but getting here should be challenging.
d THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
When the heroes reach the Imperial Capital, they should be well on their way to facing
the Villain, or at least fully understanding their wicked plans. The PCs’ arrival might
throw them off balance as they try to hide their true face and secret weapons from
the world. A spy network or trusty underlings will likely try to stop the PCs before they
discover something noteworthy, and could even decide to preemptively crush those
that oppose them before it’s too late.
O
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 What’s the first thing you notice when nearing Endir?
 Trust and loyalty are rare sights in Endir. Someone in the city can help you,
but you can’t completely trust them. Why?
 Who is the highest Imperial authority?
Why are they respected and feared?
 One of the magitech workers is an old acquaintance or relative of yours.
How long has it been since you last met?
 An anti-imperialist group works in the shadows of the capital.
What is the password for contacting them?
 How do the people of Endir react to your presence?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Endir into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the story
by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE DOME
A massive fortress-factory housing the Imperial Research Center rises from the middle
of Endir. Getting in would be the best way to discover the Empire’s plans or sabotage
its weapons.
 Watched. Day and night, magitech constructs patrol the Dome’s perimeter, while
magic crystals detect intruders. Exploring the Dome uses an eight-section “Alert!”
Clock. Fill sections due to failed Checks, when characters attract too much attention,
or when they search every nook and cranny of an area. Once it fills up, the base goes
on lockdown, and the PCs become the target of a new weapon’s “test run”.
 Progress. The Dome is a cutting-edge structure like none the PCs have seen before –
clean and futuristic, but impossible to fully comprehend. The Empire’s best minds toil
restlessly here for the good and glory of the people… or do they? Who’s in control, and
who has doubts? Why are so many areas off-limits?
 War room. This exclusive area has its own vulcan-train station – perhaps an escape
route should things go south? – and hosts the Imperial army’s strategy briefings. If
the PCs are unlucky, they might even run into a Villain: perhaps a high military officer,
or even the Emperor himself – with their retinue, of course. It could be an excellent
chance to learn more about their plans…
 Experimental hangar. A maze of labs where the Empire holds a still inactive crystal
golem: Prototype Y-Mir. The golem is a magitech marvel, far above the heroes’
abilities – it is one of the Empire’s ultimate weapons, after all. At best, the group
can hope to flee before it unleashes its Spirit Blast. But what missing component
is stopping the golem from activating? How will it be used? The PCs can discover
its essential functions by researching or communicating with it. They might even
manage to make a few minor “tweaks” … or turn the golem against the Empire itself!
 The secret room. One of the Dome’s off-limits wings guards a large crystal, within
which dwells Halo, an experimental artificial Arcanum. If treated kindly, it will tell its
story – the Empire stole the crystal from a rival people and is using it to create and
control the constructs in the city and army. How can it be stopped?

b A SUPERB MIND
Doctor Heart is one of Endir’s leading personalities. She is a true trailblazer in the
field of crystallomancy, a discipline that has already brought great glory and prestige
to the Empire.
 Different opinions. While near the capital’s gates, the PCs hear a rumor suggesting
that Dr. Heart never appears in public. Some believe she is simply sick, or spending
all her time in her laboratory, while others suspect she has incurred the wrath of a
rival – but who would oppose her research? What does the group know about Heart’s
discoveries? Has one of them met her before?
 An unlikely mediator. Vygor, a shifty man obsessed with crystals, claims to be Heart’s
personal assistant. He offers to take the heroes to the good doctor’s secret hideout,
where they will receive aid. What are the PCs’ reasons for trusting him, or not?
 A precious ally. Dr. Heart can provide safe passage into the city and information about
the Empire’s plans – and who knows what else! However, she is extremely cautious
and suffers from bad health due to pollution so she always relies on Vygor as a gobetween.
Why is she helping the heroes? Is Vygor loyal, or will he betray her if the
price is right?
? THE RESISTANCE
The local branch of the resistance, led by a mysterious person called “the Duke”,
reaches out to the group, promising crucial intel. Who is their messenger? How did
they manage to locate and reach the PCs?
 The hideout. What does the resistance’s hideout look like? Where is it? Why has the
Empire not found it, despite the actions of resistance members in the city?
 Rebel Lily. The Duke asks the heroes to escort a key resistance member out of Endir:
she is none other than Princess Lilian, the Emperor’s daughter. What distinctive trait
or feature marks her as an imperial scion? Can the mark be hidden? Crucially: why
is Lilian rebelling and ready to flee the capital? What does she think of the Player
Characters, and why?
 Neela. This infamous bounty hunter is after the princess! She wields a massive axe
that inflicts the slow status effect on multiple targets, and can also deal additional
damage to those who already suffer from slow. Who among the characters has met
Neela before? What do you know about her weak spots?
Endir the Great never sleeps. How could it, amid the constant
screeching of metal and magic that birth the Empire’s terrible weapons.

LANDS OF CATACLYSM

Beyond the edge of the known world lies a vast green expanse without cities, roads,
or people. Long ago, this region was made witness to events that shaped the known
world’s very survival, but which are now lost to history, along with the true name of
this great plain. Some secrets are better left hidden – or at least, so believed those
who penned the Chronicles.

 Information about forgotten people or stories.
 Some crucial answers for the campaign’s resolution.
d LOCATION
Verge is a dangerous place full of secrets that could help the heroes unravel the
campaign’s plot, pointing them towards its conclusion. For this reason, and also
because of its remote position, a group should ideally visit the Lands of Cataclysm
during the final act of the campaign, were PCs to defy all forbiddances in their search
for the world’s hidden truths and the Villain’s goals.
d THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Since places like Verge hide the answers to the world’s great mysteries and the
antagonists’ plans, we might surmise that this is where it all began. Said plans
shouldn’t affect the characters too directly; instead, they should merely happen upon
traces of the Villain here. Their opponents might have already understood the truth
about this location’s secrets, and be acting accordingly.

 What marks the border between civilization and forbidden territories?
 Nature reclaims the forgotten ruins. What happened to this place,
and what clues remain?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Verge into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the story

$ THE RUINS OF PANDORA
Dozens of floating rock fragments lazily circle the tip of a jagged spire that reaches
toward the sky. The Ruins of Pandora are inhabited by some of the world’s most
imposing and terrifying winged creatures – an adventurer’s deadliest nightmare.
 The spire. Before reaching the ruins, the group must climb the spire. What people have
made this rocky area their home? Why are they not mentioned in any history book? Why
do they see the characters as a greater danger than the monsters in the ruins?
 Living memory. The top of the spire holds the ruins of an ancient temple covered
in vines and worn by the elements. Here lives Stribog, an odd, winged creature that
communicates telepathically through visions. What has she seen in the ruins? How
ancient is she, and how did she come to be?
 The broken sanctuary. The closer the group gets, the more the ruins look like the
floating fragments of an ancient stone building. Elemental laws behave bizarrely
here and the larger pieces of debris shift position regularly, smashing into each other.
 The Life Machine. In the center of the ruins, the PCs find a cold icosahedral structure:
Pandora’s Box, a massive artifact that can bring the dead back to life. What does the
machine look like, and what awful energy source does it require? What aspect of life
can the box never bring back? What did the ancient civilization resurrect, and how did
they lose control over the box? And most importantly, who among the heroes wishes
to activate the machine to try and bring back someone lost?
 The horrors of the past. Scattered around the machine lie the time-worn remains of
failed resurrection attempts, carefully catalogued by the ancients. Tragically, a spark
of life still burns within some of these monsters and undead, and they may attack
the characters. Which of the creatures can communicate? Who among the Player
Characters realizes they can understand this ancient tongue?

CHAPTER
b FORGOTTEN BY HISTORY
In the center of Verge lies a great battlefield cluttered with ancient wrecks, still
bearing the scars of brutal magic. The Forgotten King, once a hero of the battle and
now transformed by the Lands of Cataclysm, wanders endlessly across the battlefield.
 The great mistake. The Forgotten King might choose not to unleash his wrath, instead
granting access to his memories, and showing the group the day the world changed
and Verge came to be. However, the PCs must hold on tightly to their feelings and
desires or they will be trapped in the king’s vision. What do they hang onto?
 The Forgotten King. The King is an undead specter (a minor Villain) who never
rejoined the stream of souls. He still wears the armor he wore when he was alive
and wields the Blade of Sorrow, a sword inflicting weak and shaken. The weapon
and its wielder are inseparable until defeat. Raising the sword skyward, the king
summons memories of fallen soldiers or channels his tormented sense of loss to
gain Resistance against physical damage. He is Vulnerable to fire damage. During
combat he keeps speaking to the heroes, his voice grave and sad.
 Dark frustration. If the PCs defeat the king, they gain the Blade of Sorrow. This
powerful artifact is a mighty greatsword granting Resistance to physical damage
and inflicting the weak and shaken status effects on a successful hit. However, the
wielder inevitably draws the ire of the restless dead.
? UNSEEN PREDATOR
An old, fortified outpost stands on Verge’s border – a meeting place for adventurers
like Will, a young man desperately searching for his sister. Sadly, he has no means of
hiring mercenaries.
 Guilt. Will thinks that his sister Powell joined an expedition to prove her mettle
after the two of them had a nasty fight. Her party was later attacked by a mysterious
monstrosity, apparently leaving no survivors.
 Canyon Spectre. Powell has spent the last several days fending off a Dolgange, a
burly monster with chameleon-like abilities: it turns invisible during odd-numbered
rounds of combat.. Though exhausted and in Crisis, Powell helps the group by wielding
her spear and using the Breach Skill (see Core Rulebook, page 219).
 A bitter gift. As a reward, Powell offers the Player Characters her brave glaive (see
Core Rulebook, page 277). Is she planning to renounce the adventurer’s life?
“Those who passed the final outpost
found all the answers... pity they never came back!”

THE CITY OF THE ANCIENTS
W
Once the heart of an ancient and advanced civilization, Arcantis could not outrun
fate and was swallowed by darkness. All that remains are crumbling ruins that cling
to the sides of a narrow chasm, surmounted by unrecognizable structures that cause
both fear and respect in passing travelers. Some say that the City of Ancients holds no
more than rubble and the shards of past greatness. Perhaps they have just not delved
deep enough…

 An unstable energy source pulsating below it – a magic vortex or volcano?
 Odd constructs on patrol that only respond to orders in a forgotten tongue.
 Buildings with hard-to-define purposes.
 Contraptions or magic wellsprings that heal living beings.
d LOCATION
In high fantasy tales, an ancient civilization has already faced the main Villain or
something very similar to them, and lost – or, they might have sacrificed themselves
long ago to save the world. Learning the truth about Arcantis should drive the PCs
to begin the campaign’s final stretch – the knowledge gained can help solve an
impending crisis or lead to an ultimate confrontation with the Villain.
d THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Great secrets and powerful magic were lost during the fall of Arcantis, which the Villain
may wish to claim and put to use. For example, they may want to build a legendary
weapon, discover the secret behind the eternal life of constructs, or decipher the
ultimate spell which they believed to be lost. Moreover, a shrewd antagonist might
very well exploit the group’s investigations to unveil a mystery without getting their
hands dirty.

 How is the magic that fills the City of the Ancients familiar?
What memories does it bring back, and why?

What did it look like then? Why is the memory so vivid?
 What led you to this forgotten place?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Arcantis into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE PLANETARIUM
The grand structure above the ruins was once an observatory dedicated to studying
the celestial spheres. Now it imprisons the souls of those Arcanteans who could not
escape the cataclysm.
 The long road. Only one road leads to the Planetarium and it is patrolled by many
constructs ready to fight in defense of their ancient masters. Will the PCs face them,
or do they have something else up their sleeves? What mysterious source of energy
allows these machines to still function?
 The Astral Fulcrum. The observatory combines several architectural styles, making
it impossible to determine who built it – though a Loremaster might have some
insights about that. The observatory’s central room stands apart from the rest,
emitting a dense magic aura that an Entropist or other expert spellcaster can identify
as Entropism. Where does this power come from? Perhaps from the celestial bodies
carved into the structure’s rings? The Arcanteans seem to somehow be linked to this
magic, which prevents them from returning to the stream of souls after death. What
rare material or artifact works as a seal?
 Prayer. The spirits of the Arcanteans tell their tale. Why are their souls trapped there?
Was it a tragic mistake or a desperate attempt to outlive their doomed civilization?
What happened to Arcantis, exactly? If the PCs free the trapped souls before venturing
onward, the spirits may show them a vision revealing a hidden truth, showing past
events, or opening a way previously barred.
 Fight for souls. When the group reaches Arcantis, the Villains might have already
started to control the Arcanteans’ souls – create an eight-section Clock that fills at
the end of each conflict round or, possibly, on a failed Check during exploration. How
will the Villains use the stolen energy? Will it feed an awful machine or spell?

b THE ECLIPSE
In Arcantis’ lower reaches, amid damaged buildings and rubble, lie the remains of the
magitech labs of this once mighty people. In a secret hangar, sheltered from ruin, a
mysterious Arcantean airship awaits: the Eclipse.
 AI. When boarding the Eclipse, the PCs discover that the ship is “alive” and governed
by a complex artificial intelligence named Layla. She is not happy to welcome non-
Arcanteans onboard. How will they convince her to collaborate?
 Unfinished business. The Eclipse is a working prototype, but it was never completed.
What was its former purpose? What powers it? What sets it apart from today’s
airships? Which of its functions is incomplete, and what are the risks of recklessly
activating its protocol?
 The twin. Layla mentions that her memories reference something labeled as her
“twin”. She recalls nothing else. What could this cryptic memory refer to?
? THE JUDGE
When a Player Character uses magic for the first time within Arcantis, the earth
begins to shake, awakening Hadenor the Judge from his long slumber. Soon after, the
group encounters Krizia, an Arcantean soul who is somehow capable of leaving the
Planetarium. She begs the heroes to put the tormented monster to rest.
 Guardian. Krizia reveals that Hadenor was created to prevent the abuse of magic and
once acted as guardian of Arcantis. However, he could not stop the downfall. What
were the first signs of this impending doom?
 Hadenor. The guardian of Arcantis (a minor Villain) is a shadow of his former self.
He is confused, furious, and tormented by the past. The heroes may eventually reason
with him, but not before a fight. He Resists physical damage but is Vulnerable to any
damage dealt by Arcana or spells. He cannot be poisoned and wields a morrigan
(Core Rulebook, page 277).
 Purification. If the PCs manage to purify Hadenor, the guardian will aid their quest
in Arcantis before peacefully returning to the stream of souls. The characters also
receive his morrigan, which deals light damage instead of dark. If the PCs fail to help
Hadenor, or abandon him, the antagonists might capture and force him into servitude,
creating a new minor Villain.
“A pinnacle of culture and magical lore, Arcantis was
the first among nations. It was also the first that fell to the darkness.”

 Great, widespread silence.
 Laws that could be seen as absurd anywhere else.
d LOCATION
Being a Realm in the Sky, Seraphim should only be reachable during the second part of
the campaign, perhaps as a key step during the final act. To travel above the clouds, the
PCs will need adequate means of transportation or know someone willing to help them
with such a feat. Being so far away from all they know will also prove quite deadly…
d THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
If the campaign is nearing its end, the characters may have sought Seraphim to obtain
a great power, crucial to defeating one or more major Villains. If there are still rivals in
play, they might be seeking the same power, which means the heroes will need to fend
them off while also dealing with the dangers posed by the realm – perhaps settling
the matter once and for all.

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Seraphim into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ BABILIS ACROPOLIS
Shrouded in mist, the highest part of Seraphim is an imposing series of square
buildings featuring silent, lofty spires.
 Breathless. The Mist is thicker here. Anyone without a mask loses a variable number
of Mind Points, depending on how much Mist they inhale.
 Master craft. Though reserved, the locals enjoy trade and produce extremely precious
accessories, besides the unique Mist masks.
 Marble palace. Queen Apate (see below) lives in the highest building of the
acropolis. A nearby tower hides the complex device known as the Mist engine... which
is also what keeps Seraphim afloat! Can the characters eliminate the Mist without
destroying the realm? What rare material does the machine contain?
b THE TRUE QUEEN
The Masked Queen is feared and revered by all of Seraphim. For centuries, she has
held the city in her sway, hiding her schemes behind fake smiles and elegant words.
 Tyrant! Apate is a despot who disrespects everyone and everything – so why has
nobody found the courage to resist her power? If confronted, she remains unfazed
and counters with teasing words drenched in lies. Apate can fly and appears ethereal:
she almost resembles the goddess Aletheia (see below), though her face is hidden by
an elaborate mask, different from those of other inhabitants.
 To arms! In combat, the queen (a major Villain) wields a special two-handed ferula
(Core Rulebook, page 270) dealing【 HR + 6】 damage. If she removes her mask, she
can emit a Magic Breath which drains HP and inflicts the shaken status effect. She
also casts spells that deal air damage and inflict poisoned. Apate Resists air and ice
damage but is Vulnerable to bolt. When she reaches Crisis, Apate hides behind an
ethereal shell that gives her Resistance to physical damage. Once protected, she uses
the Mist to steal the PCs’ Mind Points each round.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 An end to lies. If the characters have the Mirror of Truth (see below), they can use
it while confronting the queen to start an eight-section Clock. Once complete, the
mirror shatters, Apate’s mask turns to dust, and the queen returns to Aletheia’s proper
form. Even without the mirror, the PCs may use a Ritual or Fabula Point to make such
an approach possible.
 Truth or lie? If freed, Aletheia tells the group her story. Why did she become Apate?
Why was she forced to remove Seraphim from the world? What role did the mask
play in all this? Once she has regained her powers – some of which Apate could
perhaps not access – Aletheia could ask the group’s opinion on Seraphim’s fate: is
it time to return to earth, ending the long isolation? If Aletheia remains Apate and
the PCs defeat her, they can take the Oxis mask, an artifact that makes its wearer
invisible. Careful, though, it doesn’t work against those who are used to deception –
like Villains!
? THE PRINCESS AND THE MIRROR
Princess Amber – recently arrived from a far-off realm with her retinue – desperately
needs the PCs’ help to find a precious artifact.
 Friends or foes? The princess asks the characters about the Mirror of Truth, an
artifact believed to unmask all lies. Where is Amber from, and why does she need
the mirror? The people of Seraphim are not inclined to help her – and what’s that
glimmer on their masks? – you can’t just trust anyone these days…
 The plan. To locate the position of the mirror you’ll need a lot of luck – and perhaps
a Fabula Point! Once found, the artifact must also be recovered – how will the
characters handle this part?
 The guardians. Any misstep will bring down the wrath of the White Masks, merciless
spear-fighters who guard the mirror. During conflict, the Mist also helps the White
Masks, causing minor losses of Mind Points to all those who breathe it. Why is this
faction so tied to the Mist? Who do they truly serve?
 A possible ally. Amber might want to leave Seraphim on her airship once she has the
mirror – but not without paying her debt to the group. What will she offer to thank
them for the aid? Will she follow the PCs, or does she still need their help to deal
with troubles back home?
“If you seek truth in Seraphim, do not look behind the masks
of its people: nothing but silence lies there.”

of one of the elements, await the PCs here to stop them once and for all.
 Corrupted elements. All four Guardians participate in the fight. They are soldier-rank
creatures bound together – in terms of Ultima Points, consider them like a single
major Villain. Has the group faced them before?
 Basilisk. The Fire Guardian has a gaze that steals Mind Points, and membranes that
Absorb fire damage but are Vulnerable to ice. His presence creates a four-section
Clock that fills by 1 at the end of each of his turns. Once full, the magical energy
explodes, dealing heavy damage to his foes.
 Calypso. Quick to rage, the Water Guardian Absorbs ice damage but is Vulnerable to
fire. She casts potent frost spells that inflict the enraged status effect, and can call
upon the power of water to make all Guardians Resistant to physical damage.
 Garuda. The Air Guardian surveys the battlefield from above, casting the Heal spell
(Core Rulebook, page 209) when necessary. At the end of each of Garuda’s turns, if
she is airborne, fill one section of a six-section Clock. Once it is full she uses her
Cyclone Strike, which inflicts heavy damage. Garuda Absorbs air damage and is
Vulnerable to earth.
 Nosferat. The deathly Earth Guardian inflicts the slow status effect with his Death
Roots and knows spells like Acceleration, Dispel, Drain Vigor, and Terra (Core
Rulebook, pages 189 and 192). He Absorbs earth damage and is Vulnerable to air.
 Bonds. When a Guardian falls, the others lose 10 Hit Points and 10 Mind Points each.
Why? What tales and past memories bind them together?
 Elemental might. For each of the Guardians who falls, the PCs feel the might of the
associated element coursing through their veins. What powers do they obtain? What
must they sacrifice to use the new abilities in the final battle?

b THE CRYSTAL HALL
The fortress has a side wing guarded by creatures of darkness. One of the PCs feels a
strange call that draws them down these halls.
 Old blood. That Player Character is a descendant of one of the heroes who gave their
lives at Concussio Mundi centuries ago, and whose spiritual energy has left lasting
traces. Did they already know, or did they only find this out now?
 To Best oneself. Fearing their undying power, the Villain has sealed the spiritual
energy of past heroes within crystal sarcophagi, protected by dark magic: there is
one sarcophagus per Player Character. One by one, each PC must reveal their worst
nightmares and explain how their Bonds allow them to confront and defeat them.
 Strength and memories. By defeating their fears, the heroes obtain their ultimate
weapons, each bearing the name of its former wielder. They are indestructible weapons
valued at over 2000 zenit, which the group should create together. How does each
weapon reflect the heroes’ nature and personal growth during the campaign?
? IMPRISONED POWER
As they explore Concussio Mundi, a voice guides the heroes deeper into the fortress.
Here, within a room with glass and obsidian walls covered in runes, lies imprisoned
Eza, a Jinn with great magical power.
 Sabotage. The Villain is draining the Jinn’s magic, and soon, nothing will remain. If
they destroy the seals that bind him, the characters can free Eza and severely reduce
the Villain’s abilities during the final battle.
 Warning. Eza magically compelled to serve the Villain against his own will – he longs
for freedom but warns the characters that he will attack should they try and break the
seals. He knows light and dark spells and changes his Absorption and Vulnerability
based on the last spell he cast.
 Precious gifts. If the group promises Eza freedom, he will reveal one of the Villain’s
Traits or Vulnerabilities. If they free him, Eza might join the final battle or teach the
PCs a powerful spell or Ritual.
“We gave it many names, trying to soothe our fear.
Even so, it remains unchanged: Concussio Mundi, the apocalypse.”

CONFLICTS
The next pages provide suggestions to help you build high fantasy conflicts. They
explore these situations from a rules perspective – which the Core Rulebook also
discusses at length from page 58 – but, more importantly, they focus on the narrative
tensions at play during clashes between individuals or factions.
A CLASH OF IDEALS
When building high fantasy conflicts, always try to understand what grand ideals are
at odds: the high fantasy genre is often defined by the tragic conflict between opposite
worldviews and tragically incompatible perspectives which upset and disrupt the lives
of people.
Pay special attention to these elements:
 PC Identities and Themes. Conflict should always focus on the core elements of one
or more Player Characters. Though the conflict might not affect the PCs directly, it can
center on a concept or ideal they hold close, in order to test the heroes’ convictions.
If a situation doesn’t touch upon the Identity or Themes of any of the PCs, you may
wish to rethink it a bit to make it more relevant.
 The Villain’s plan. All conflicts should be part of one or more Villains’ plans – at
least, the situation should allow an antagonist to pursue their goals, whether known
or secret.
 High stakes. High fantasy is an over-the-top genre, so its conflicts should have
dramatic effects that echo through the whole setting. The antagonist doesn’t just
want to conquer the city, but wishes to destroy a magic temple in order to release
the demons trapped beneath its premises; the prototype airship isn’t just a veritable
vessel, but a flying fortress; the grand dragon of the north isn’t merely a formidable
foe, but the bringer of a new ice age; and so on.
 Unexpected twists. As they play out, conflicts reveal new information about characters,
historical events, and the world’s secrets. This concept can help you deal with defeat:
for instance, you could use an Ultima Point as an antagonist flees the scene to have
them let slip some critical bit of information – this can lessen the frustration caused
by their escape – or a PC that has just surrendered might be saved by someone who
can also provide valuable answers.

CHAPTER
WAR AND BATTLES
While combat is surely the most common type of conflict in high fantasy, it is crucial
to consider the following points:
 Battle is a failure. Though Fabula Ultima’s rules make for some awesome combat
scenes, you should think of battle and the use of violence as the final, desperate play
when all else fails – perhaps even a choice made to avoid something worse.
There’s nothing wrong with playing a character hellbent on vengeance and war –
that’s what the Anger and Vengeance Themes are for! – but both their Player and
the rest of the group are responsible for making sure the character evolves over time.
 Allies are crucial. If the characters find allies who will fight by their side, or if
they’re unable to, this must have some impact on the game. These NPCs might join
scenes and provide their help directly, or eliminate troublesome enemies before
the engagement even begins. Conversely, a party of heroes lacking support should
find ways to infiltrate enemy lines with a stealthier approach, avoiding open conflict
during the first part of their mission.
“Regardless of your choice,
you will never be able to
foresee all the consequences
of your actions. Nevertheless,
hesitating will surely not
aid those you love.”
62
W
W
d BATTLES WITH MANY FOES
During high fantasy campaigns, especially near the end, protagonists will often take
part in scenes involving large numbers of foes.
Some classic examples include a battle between armies, a desperate stand against
oncoming hordes of soldiers, infiltrating a palace crawling with guards, or a fight
against dozens of awakened golems.
You can’t run scenes like these by treating each enemy as an individual creature: the
game’s balance would suffer, and things would get very clunky. Instead, focus on the
crucial elements, and treat the rest abstractly.
For example, you could:
 Zoom in on the action. Try focusing on a single, mighty foe, using the rest of the
scene as a backdrop. After all, in these stories, the enemy army often routs once their
general falls.
 Use environmental effects. You can simplify some elements of battle and turn them
into features of the environment. For example, have the enemy catapults deal minor
damage to a random PC at the end of each round – or at least until they disable the
threat with a Clock or opportunity.
 Creature swarms. You can use the rules for swarms (Core Rulebook, page 297): an
archer becomes a unit of archers, a magitech soldier becomes a magitech battalion,
and so on. This allows you to have genuinely epic scenes where a PC can sunder
the armor of an entire unit using Breach (Core Rulebook, page 219) or lay waste to
whole enemy lines by striking not three individuals but three different units with
their Ignis spell (Core Rulebook, page 189). Nothing changes rule-wise, but the
effects can become explosive in terms of the storytelling.
 Use tons of enemies. Round after round, waves of enemies (Core Rulebook, page 298)
might keep appearing to aid the main antagonist.
The basic rule remains unchanged: don’t overcomplicate things. Plausibility and
“realism” are secondary in JRPGs, when they’re not irrelevant and unhelpful – especially
in high fantasy contexts.

CHAPTER
d EXTRAORDINARY AND COLOSSAL BEINGS
Breathtaking battles against massive magical creatures with strange powers are a
staple of the high fantasy genre.
 No limits. Your heroes in Fabula Ultima can face down colossal foes, from elder
dragons to golems as tall as buildings.
 Incarnations. This concept recurs in many JRPGs and resonates with the idea that
conflicts should be primarily between ideals, which may even take physical form and
fight (see Gods and Demons, page 71).
 Unique abilities. These adversaries should have special and memorable strengths
and weaknesses; you can take inspiration from myths and legends of the real world
– that’s also a great place to find epic names.
d AERIAL BATTLES
Dragons, angels, winged mounts, airships, and even flying characters (see page 118)
are a relatively common sight in high fantasy worlds – sooner or later, you will find
yourself engaged in an aerial battle.
 Nothing new. In some senses, “if we all fly, no one flies” is true: combatants should be
able to reach each other without issues, as usual.
 Falling. Letting a defeated PC plummet from the sky might be tempting, but they
should have some way to save themselves, unless they’re making a Sacrifice. Perhaps
a well-placed flying creature or sky-pirate ship?
 Unsaddled. Any rider on a winged mount can be knocked from the saddle using
a Clock. If you need to distinguish between rider and mount, treating the two as
separate creatures in the battle, it might be helpful for the mount to have a Skill
which allows it to extend its flying ability to the rider.
 Aircraft. Usually, an aircraft will function as a stage for your battles and will need no
statistics – though you can make the scene memorable by describing the sails torn
by magic, the smoking motors, and the bridge ripped apart by the claws of a mighty
beast. When the situation focuses on aircraft, you can rely on opposed Clocks without
necessarily starting a conflict scene – otherwise, you might consider the enemy
vessels as constructs, in typical JRPG fashion.
64
W
W
RULERS, HIERARCHIES, AND AUDIENCES
Kingdoms and empires appear frequently in high fantasy settings, usually ruled by a
sole sovereign or a council of some kind. The importance of these rulers varies from
one world to another, but the following advice is helpful in multiple settings:
 Details as needed. You don’t need to name every single council member, aristocrat, or
lordling. As usual, you can assume that the story will focus on the handful of figures
who are able to aid or hinder the protagonists.
 Emerging importance. If a Player spends a Fabula Point to introduce a political or
social situation or a character who provides aid, including finding an Unexpected Ally
(Core Rulebook, page 201), that character immediately becomes relevant to the story,
sometimes to their own detriment.
 An eye for decorum. Navigating local customs can be challenging, especially in
places that value noble blood, formalities, and respect for authority – you might end
up in conflict before you even know it! In these cases, the rank and origin of the
Player Characters can greatly aid or hinder the situation – the GM should always
provide transparent information about these possibilities.
 Backup plan. Remember that Fabula Ultima is a heroic and optimistic game, so if
the characters fail to achieve their goals during an audience with an influential
figure, they should have ample chance to recover from the blunder. That might mean
violating decorum or breaking laws, but that’s a necessary price when trying to make
the world a better place.
Last but not least: the dynamics of scenes focusing on intrigue, social pressure, and
the weight of tradition and social norms are naturally closer to our everyday life than
Fabula Ultima’s typical over-the-top situations. Sometimes, bringing these elements
into play might worsen your experience, especially for those seeking a bit of relaxed
and heroic escapism.
In other words, many Players would rather fight the incarnation of an oppressive legal
system, rather than play out a long debate about its faults.
Tackling this question is a good thing to do at the start of your campaign as it may very
well influence world and character creation – the Orator Class, for example, excels in
these contexts.

SOMETHING MEMORABLE
Spectacular events are crucial in all high fantasy scenes where there are tensions
or conflicts. They might come from a specific rule, an emotional connection, or mere
aesthetic – what matters is making the scene memorable.
Here are some examples:
A desperate attempt to stop a lumbering machine from destroying a sacred shrine. You
must divide your actions between reducing the machine’s Clock and disabling it – the
Clock automatically fills by 1 section at the end of each round.
A duel against a witch’s stern and loyal bodyguard, who is ready to travel into the past
to remedy the mistakes that made them both Villains – little do they know that this
action will bear dire consequences or fail miserably.
The fight against an ancient demon that wields weapons inspired by the cardinal sins
– or cardinal virtues for beings tied to light and order.
A dancing and/or singing competition against a socialite who uses their charisma to
ensnare the capital’s public opinion – the background music is not optional!
A tense face-to-face with someone you once trusted, but was later revealed to be a
Villain with elaborate schemes. Once again, they try to sway you to their side.
The assault on an ironclad flying ship, divided into two
phases: you must first take out several soldier-rank
turrets, then use the breaches to reach the bridge and
face the champion-rank enemy commander.
A battle at the edge of reality itself,
fought across the body of a slowly
reforming chaos god.
66
W
MAGIC AND RITUALS
In all its many facets, magic is a core element of high fantasy worlds. At the end of a
campaign, you will often notice that all the main events had a profoundly supernatural
dimension. From the skeleton army to the great dragon that accompanied you in the
final stretch of the adventure, magic was always a part of your story, often intertwined
with technology (see page 74) and religious practices.
These pages provide tips and advice for managing magic and Rituals in your high
fantasy campaigns – you can think of them as adding to the information found in the
Core Rulebook.
ARCANA AND SUMMONS
Summoning spectacular ancestral beings is a staple of high fantasy and in Fabula
Ultima, this trope is represented by the Arcana, who will often play a crucial role in
your campaigns.
 Living among you. In high fantasy worlds, the Arcana are within reach and you can
usually communicate with them, often in particular locations or through Rituals.
These beings either play an active and intentional role in world events or have
personal reasons not to partake in them.
An Arcanum in its “complete and true” form is essentially a demon (see Gods and
Demons, page 71). Demons are “born” from worship of a mythological entity,
highly-celebrated heroes of the past, or the physical manifestation of an ideal or
universal emotion.
 Borrowed power. Regardless of how you obtain an Arcanum, what you hold is but a
fraction of the power derived from a concept or ancient being. This power might be
lent willingly, or can be obtained by anyone who performs the appropriate rites. It
may entail a test of bravery or some bizarre requirement connected to the Arcanum’s
domains. In the latter case, if you can draw on the Arcanum’s power even without
its consent – assuming it’s self-aware – you shouldn’t be surprised to discover the
Villains wielding it as well.
 Imitations. Summoning an Arcanum means shaping your soul into the form of a
powerful and ancient being. Nevertheless, even when using the Heroic Skill Grand
Summoning (see page 156), the result will be a pale imitation of the original being,
influenced by the Arcanist’s unique perception and understanding of that specific
concept or entity.

CHAPTER
d THEMED GROUPS
High fantasy stories often reference groups: the Seven Heavenly Blades, the Five
Elemental Crystals, and so on. This concept works well when applied to Arcana – for
example, the game world might be protected by the Six Ancient Pillars or influenced
by the Twelve Arcana of the Zodiac.
There is often also a “final, hidden Arcanum”, which might act as a fulcrum to one of
the campaign’s mysteries or be discovered anew using the Revelation Heroic Skill
(Core Rulebook, page 240).
d MORE THAN ONE ARCANIST
If Arcana are common or crucial for the campaign, your group may want to include
more than one Arcanist. If so, consider this:
 Do you really need it? You might not need multiple characters with Classes focused
on summoning. The Zero Powers (see page 124) might do the trick if all you need
to do is granting everyone an awesome power they can call upon in times of need.
 Arcana subgroups. Some characters might bond with all types of Arcana, while others
may be limited to specific subgroups. The second option has great flair, but it might
require new Arcana. If you use the first option, all of your group might participate
in the bonding process – instead of each Arcanist doing so alone – and an Arcanum
might have visual variations (see next page) depending on who summons it.
?
“The Five Sovereigns keep
Creation in balance:
frost, wind, earth, bolt,
and flame. But legend
tells of a Sixth Sovereign,
exiled centuries ago….”
68
W
W
d VISUAL VARIATIONS
The form of each Arcanum may vary depending on the game world or on who summons
it, without modifying any of its mechanical effects. For example, a swordswoman might
summon Arcana in the shape of legendary swords that whirl about her, while a priest
might give them the shape of ethereal apparitions tied to his traditions.
d NEW ARCANA
The Core Rulebook mentions the creation of custom Arcana on page 178. Custom
Arcana are a great addition to high fantasy campaigns, especially if the world’s Arcana
are inspired by specific mythologies or have a unique and crucial role in the story.
There are no strict rules for making new Arcana, but the process must involve the
collaboration of all people at the table.
That being said, here are a few essential tips:
 Simplicity. If an existing Arcanum or a combination of existing ones can do the job,
you can simply modify some of the minor details – name, domains, damage type,
Resistances granted, etc. However, try to consider how these changes influence the
power level of your Arcanum: combining the merge effect of the Sword with the
dismiss effect of the Forge may well be too powerful!
 Moderation. No Arcanum should be able to do “a little bit of everything” or be “a
strictly better version of another Arcanum”. The Game Master’s job in Fabula Ultima is
to make the protagonists shine, so there is truly no need to chase ever greater power
at all costs.
 Sensible and useful domains. When choosing domains, try to ensure that they
channel the Arcanum’s personality and themes and are helpful for Arcanism Rituals.
Avoid redundant domains – if some come up, take a step back and revise the base
idea for your Arcanum.
Lastly, when you create Arcana based on mythological figures from the real world, it
can be a good idea to research them and educate yourselves on the role they played in
society and culture – you might even stumble upon exciting details that can contribute
to the creative process.

CHAPTER
EXAMPLE: ARCANUM OF TAURUS
You’ve created a world in which the Arcana are based on the twelve signs of the
zodiac: their merge and dismiss effects all connect to the qualities traditionally
associated with each sign. Here, we are discussing Taurus, the bull, which might derive
from the Mesopotamian zodiac and especially the figure of Gugalanna, the legendary
heavenly bull whose “steps shook the earth”.
Taurus is tied to the earth and represents patience, tenacity, and reflection before
action. These elements are ideal for defensive effects, but we can avoid making
an overly one-dimensional Arcanum by including at least one active effect – the
dismiss power is perfect.
We can envision a merge effect granting immunity to the weak and enraged status
effects – representing the bull’s strength of body and mind – plus a dismiss effect
like many other Arcana described in the Core Rulebook from page 179 on, but
dealing earth damage.
The result isn’t bad, if perhaps a bit underpowered compared to other Arcana. The
closest parallel is with the Arcanum of the Frost, which provides Resistance, and also
allows its ice damage to ignore Resistances. Truth be told, ice damage is a bit more
efficient than earth, so we add a small bonus tied to Mind Point recovery, which aligns
nicely with Taurus’ ability to stubbornly endure.

BOUDICCA, REBEL LANCE
Kanna, the group’s Knight Errant, has mastered the Arcanist Class and obtained the
Revelation Heroic Skill (Core Rulebook, page 240). The newfound Arcanum should
play a crucial role in the story, tying in to the fact that Kanna and the group have just
decided to return to his homeland to help the local resistance.
During the campaign, another Player introduced a legendary heroine within the story,
who she called Boudicca in homage to the historical figure. Kanna’s Player would like
to make Boudicca an Arcanum of battle, independence, and rebellion, especially as it
was the decision to aid the resistance that triggered her emergence.
Since this Arcanum was obtained with Revelation, we can agree that it could be a
bit stronger than average. Our starting model is the Arcanum of the Sword (Core
Rulebook, page 181), but with its damage type changed to light. However, this variant
of the Sword’s benefit can now target a Vulnerability – no small thing! To balance
things out, the Game Master suggests that the merge effect should make it impossible
to modify the damage type.
Finally, the dismiss effect should channel the Arcanum’s tenacious and rebellious
nature: an obvious choice could be an effect that removes physical and psychological
status effects, like that of the Arcanum of the Oak (Core Rulebook, page 180). It’s
usually not ideal to create Arcana with powerful offensive and defensive powers, but
we had already decided that Boudicca would be more potent than usual. However, we
limit the dismiss effect to when Kanna is in Crisis. That’s not a vast restriction since
being in Crisis is when this effect is most beneficial – but it must be triggered promptly!

CHAPTER
GODS AND DEMONS
Ancestral beings with godlike powers play a pivotal role in the vast majority of high
fantasy stories, and at the end of the campaign the heroes will often clash with the
gods themselves.
 Final battle. High fantasy supreme Villains are usually very ancient, powerful beings,
worshiped by some and feared by many. The whole plot might center on conflicting
worldviews, ideals, and desires, only to culminate in a head-on confrontation with the
incarnation of the concept the heroes have been fighting against since the very start
of the campaign.
 Gods as demons. The Core Rulebook (page 304) mentions that creatures of the
demon Species are the embodiment of legends and beliefs. Thus, in the worlds of
Fabula Ultima, faith, religion, tradition, and even propaganda can cause the stream of
souls to generate demons with astonishing powers. In these cases, the term “demon”
may not have a negative connotation, but is closer to the Greek concept of a dáimōn,
meaning “divine being” or “between human and divine”.
In other words, human thought can generate gods, who can then use their position
to strengthen the faith of those who believe in them, thus increasing their power, for
good or ill.
 Becoming a demon. People with incredible willpower, and individuals who are widely
feared or revered, may draw upon great power and even become demons themselves
– this could be what happens during an escalation (Core Rulebook, page 102). A
Villain could hasten their ascension by terrorizing an entire nation, manipulating
public opinion, or attracting the devotion of preexisting religious cults.
 Immortal (almost). Demons are a mass of energy held together by willpower – the
demon’s own, or that of the believers in the principles embodied. You can’t truly kill a
demon until the emotions that created it disappear, so your heroes’ role as mediators
between cultures is crucial when facing these beings. The nature of demons also
explains why they always create cults and spread rumors about themselves. This
gives you a great opportunity for a “sequel campaign”, in which a new embodiment of
the same concepts returns to threaten the world.
However, a forgotten or egotistical entity – one held together only by its own
conviction – might dissolve for good once defeated. These features can strongly
characterize your demons.
“Such hatred, such resentment… they cannot be set aside.
And they cannot be erased: I shall exist until the end of humanity!”
72
W
THE STREAM OF SOULS
The atoms of Fabula Ultima’s worlds are formed by spiritual energy: when life forms,
it originates from the stream of souls; when life ends, it returns to the stream. The
characters’ superhuman abilities also derive from the stream of souls, which should be at
least partially visible in high fantasy campaigns.
Example: creatures disappear in a burst of blue particles when they die and magical
objects emit luminous auras – visible to the naked eye – that change color depending
on their function or dominant element.
d SOULS AS TIME AND MEMORY
The stream of souls contains fragments of the memories of those who have returned to
it. High fantasy Arcana could originate from this gradual accumulation of memories, and
some characters might even tap into these ancient echoes when they use their Skills.
Taking things even further, if you think of time and space as created by perceptions
and memories, tampering with the stream of souls might even change the fabric of
reality – a great way to introduce space-time anomalies!
d A CENTRAL ROLE
In high fantasy worlds, changes to the stream of souls should be connected tightly to
your group’s objectives, or the Villains’ schemes:
 A witch plans to seal herself into an ancient machine and rewind time by reversing
the flow of the stream of souls.
 An empire tries to destroy the sacred oaks of the people they’ve waged war against
because the trees them to connect with the memories of their precursors, giving
them precious council and, on rare occasions, the ability to summon Arcana.
 A nihilist tyrant uses lies and oppressive politics to cause conflicts among his people,
which makes the stream of souls unstable and irregular. His endgame is to bring
about the spontaneous birth of a God of Chaos.
 The heroes must return the elemental gems to their temples, thus stabilizing the
stream of souls and avoiding a looming environmental disaster.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
“COMMON” AND “SPECIAL” RITUALS
Since magic plays a crucial role in high fantasy, the characters will often want to use
magic Rituals to further the story.
These Rituals will usually play one of two roles within the narrative:
 Common Rituals. The less imposing and grand forms of magic are a common sight for
most people – it may take the form of crystal torches at the sides of the roads, elemental
cores found within airship engines, or giant golems used for city maintenance.
 Special Rituals. These events are rare and tied to the main junctures of your story, like
awakening an ancient curse, trapping a dragon, or calling forth a mighty avalanche
to bury an entire village.
Both Ritual types follow the same rules – the difference lies in the role played by
special Rituals, which should leave lasting marks on the game world and how people
perceive magic.
LIFE BEYOND DEATH
Usually, in Fabula Ultima’s worlds, creatures return to the stream of souls when they
die, and blocking or twisting this process creates an undead. Some individuals may
even reincarnate as demons thanks to their great willpower or the devotion of many
followers (page 71).
However, the high fantasy setting allows for a few exceptions:
 Special methods. An object, place, or magic formula may bring back the dead without
corrupting them. If you include something of the sort in your setting, always consider
the terrible price of using it, and also the Villains’ plans – they’ll stop at nothing to
get their hands on it!
 Resurrected characters. Characters with the Revenant Quirk (see page 120) come
back to life with full awareness. Their Player must contribute to defining what the
afterlife is like in the setting.
Lastly, remember that there should be no coming back from death by Sacrifice (Core
Rulebook, page 88) – at most, the fallen hero’s spirit could appear as an NPC for a
scene to give aid or advice to their old comrades.
74
W
TECHNOLOGY
Though usually less central than magic, technology is still widespread in high fantasy
settings. Sometimes, it may merely provide aesthetic or stylistic flair, but its presence
or absence usually has a definite symbolic or narrative role.
INFLUENCES ON THE GAME
Depending on the technology available in different areas of the world, certain aspects
of play may be absent or, conversely, strengthened.
Here are some things to keep in mind:
 Travel and mobility. Easily accessible transport, especially if open to all people,
makes your game world interconnected and can significantly accelerate the pacing of
the campaign. Notably, having access to air transportation (Core Rulebook, page 125)
triples your travel speed and lets you ignore a majority of environmental obstacles.
 Projects. The joy of any Tinkerer is being in a place with abundant raw materials
and mechanical components, but at the same time, widespread industrialization may
make most inventions boilerplate.
 New Inventory items. Fabula Ultima’s group sheet contains empty spaces that can be
used to add new items available through Inventory Points in your setting. You aren’t
limited in what you can create but do consider the possible implications for the play
experience. For example, an item that revives a character who already surrendered
might make combat drag on longer than appropriate.
Try talking these things over during your session zero (Core Rulebook, pages 145 and
245), but don’t worry if you need to change or adjust your ideas during play.

CHAPTER
AESTHETICS AND MEANING
The technology of high fantasy worlds is not usually tied to a specific historical or
industrial period. On the contrary, it tends to take on hybrid forms deriving more from
aesthetic taste than practical implications.
 Spectacle and coherence. Your high fantasy technology should include one or more
imposing or extraordinary elements, but try to be coherent when you describe the
buildings, equipment, and means of transportation used in an area, or by a culture –
colors, materials, and the type of fuel used are good starting places.
 Symbolic meaning. The technology used by a particular people can often take on
ethical meaning: widespread use of steel and fossil fuels combined with heavy
industrialization point to the society’s distance from nature and lack of emotional
warmth. Conversely, a society coexisting with the natural world and whose tech is based
on marble, bronze, wood, and colorful materials takes on a dreamlike air of wonder.
In contrast to techno fantasy, technology is not usually a core theme in high fantasy,
but instead has aesthetic and symbolic roles.
THE PLACE OF MAGITECH SCIENCE
The union of magic and technology – or magitech science – is common in high
fantasy settings. Consider exploring the role of this science during your world creation
process, paying particular attention to how your heroes use it and possible differences
of opinion within your group.
 Tools with implications. Though you may consider magic and technology as mere
tools, neither good nor evil, using either may have a strong environmental, social, or
political impact. Take some time to discuss the implications of using (or misusing)
these tools within the game world.
 Avoid trite tropes. The classic struggle between “ancient, traditional magic” and
“new, invasive technology” is a common trope in fantasy stories and one that allows
for impactful scenes, however, it’s always best to avoid stereotypes. It is better to
highlight the pros and cons of both of these elements and create Villains who
embody their most extreme and toxic aspects in the hopes that your heroes will
forge a world where magic and technology coexist in harmony.

RARE ITEMS
Playing Fabula Ultima in a high fantasy setting is an excellent opportunity to go wild
and create extraordinary weapons, armor, shields, and accessories.
This section contains tips to help you imagine and describe compelling high fantasy
equipment, followed by a list of new rare items you can include in your campaigns or
use as inspiration.
AWESOME AND COLORFUL
Rare items found over the course of a high fantasy campaign should never feel dull, even
when characters are low-level.
Here are some examples:
 Lavish battle-ready weapons. These may be decorated with bronze, banners, and
precious stones. Some may display elemental auras visible to the naked eye – like
a vortex of foaming water – or consist of different sections held together by magic.
Powerfully magical weapons might levitate beside their wielder and strike of their
own accord. In all cases, these weapons still require the usual item slots.
 Splendid and refined armor. Rare armor could be crafted from extraordinary materials
like obsidian, jade, or crystal, or enhanced with exquisite decorations. Forgoing all
realism, high fantasy clothes and armor serve chiefly aesthetic purposes: they channel
the personality and style of their wearer. You might consider associating one or more
iconic colors with your character, which can guide your description of their attire.
 Mighty and varied shield. Shields come in many shapes and sizes: a gladiator’s lorica
manica, tower shields as tall as the mightiest warrior, or even elegant and enchanted
bracers that summon a defensive barrier around their wearer. Though they keep the
exact same rules of standard shields, feel free to describe these items differently
depending on who is expected to wear them.
 Accessories for all tastes. Flashy and decorative in their own right, their appearance
could vary depending on your game world and its customs. Rings, headdresses, and
necklaces are classics, but accessories can also include gems embedded into the back
of one’s hand and regal hair ornaments.
Whatever item you envision, take some time to imagine and describe some details or
visual effects that make your rare items unusual and marvelous.

MYTHOLOGICAL REFERENCES
Mythologies worldwide are rife with items with unique properties, from the swords of
the Arthurian cycle to the astra of the Rāmāyana and Mahabharata. These objects are
often somewhere between simple equipment and artifacts and they work perfectly as
a source of inspiration for rare items in JRPGs.
If you choose to be inspired by objects from the legends and myths of the real world,
make sure to research their original cultural context and purported magical abilities.
ICONIC EQUIPMENT
The characters in Fabula Ultima can equip any item as long as their Classes allow
them to do so, however, it is common in JRPGs for each protagonist to be associated
with a specific type of gear, like two-handed swords for knights and grimoires for
mages. If you want to include this aesthetic coherence in your adventures using the
Wishlist (Core Rulebook, page 123), you should work together to create a list of
“dedicated” rare items for each hero.
Another exciting option – which you will see fleshed out in the following few pages
– is creating rare items that strengthen or add flexibility to Class Skills, allowing for
interactions and synergies that would otherwise be impossible.
THAT’S... A WEAPON?!
Following the best JRPG classics, high fantasy equipment should move beyond the
“boring” options provided in the Core Rulebook – your heroes might fight using
paintbrushes, forks, or musical instruments, or perhaps their Twin Shields (Core
Rulebook, page 197) look like mighty mechanical gauntlets.
SIMPLE SOLUTIONS
You don’t usually need to change the rules when you make an item look different. For
example, an arcane weapon can be described as a flute without modifying the stats
of a staff or tome.
However, if no existing weapon takes your fancy, you can rely on the rules for Custom
Weapons on page 102.

ARTIFACTS
High fantasy takes many elements from the Fabula Ultima Core Rulebook, including
artifacts, and pushes them to the next level – whether ancient and mysterious
contraptions or legendary amulets whose magic can change the world’s fate, there’s
no limit to their power.
ANCIENT RELICS
Most high fantasy artifacts belong to bygone ages and have been hidden or wellguarded
up until the start of the campaign. Often, the theft or disappearance of one
such artifact will trigger a crisis that the Player Characters will need to face during
the first few sessions.
Recently created artifacts are much rarer – even when they exist, they are generally
embellishments or reconstructions of more ancient devices. Regardless, the
connection between these artifacts and the past history of your game world should
always remain strong.
DANGEROUS OBJECTS
Artifacts in high fantasy campaigns should be capable of unleashing terrible events,
whether because of their innate power or the prestige and authority they bestow on
those who wield them. Each artifact is an opportunity, but also a terrible temptation
for those around it.
TALKING ARTIFACTS
High fantasy artifacts may be so powerful that they develop their own consciousness,
interacting with others and becoming de facto Non-Player Characters. Though
these entities surely possess rare and ancient knowledge, they may have trouble
understanding the current state of society!
Talking artifacts can answer many of the characters’ questions, they also run the risk
of monopolizing the flow of play – best to only introduce them during the later arcs
of a campaign.

CHAPTER
ARMOR OF SUPREMACY
Fine black armor bearing a gaping dragon’s maw.
The dragon head adorning this armor is sentient and speaks in the wearer’s mind – if
they show enough bravery and ambition. Once this bond is present, the wearer can use
an action to inflict heavy fire damage (Core Rulebook, page 93) against one target,
ignoring Immunities and Resistance. The heat of the dragon’s fire is as hot as the
lava of the Black Volcano, where some believe the armor was forged. Moreover, deep
within that secluded volcano lies an ancient fortress, sealed by magic – perhaps the
armor’s true power is linked to the secrets buried inside…
BEHEMOTH’S HEART
The heart of a mighty dragon, preserved in a glass casket.
Dragons have long been considered a symbol of might and majesty, but none among
them was ever as valiant as Behemoth, Lord of Dragons. He sacrificed himself to save
his kin during the Celestial War, but his valor was such that a portion of him refused
to die: his heart.
Legends say that those who receive the approval of the spirit bound to the Behemoth’s
Heart will be granted the ability to transform into dragons themselves and will be
respected by all of dragonkind.
CHALICE OF YOUTH
A simple metal chalice decorated with an unsettling red gem.
Whoever drinks from this chalice, even if the liquid is just water, is rejuvenated and
returns to what they perceive to be their ideal shape. However, the transformation
only lasts a few days, and each use slightly changes the drinker’s personality: their
emotions are twisted and absorbed by the crimson gem adorning the chalice. Only the
youngest are immune to the artifact’s effects, but those who yearn for the mirage of
eternal youth easily fall prey to its allure.
84
W
ELEMENTAL STONES
Four colorful stones that can fit in one’s hand, and can be combined.
Water, fire, earth, and air: these four stones let their wielder perform Elementalism
Rituals tied to the corresponding natural element, without spending Mind Points and
with no Magic Check required.
Their power is immeasurable: they can light a campfire as easily as unleash the
destructive fury of a volcano or tidal wave. However, their true potential is only revealed
when they combine – whoever can do so will master the Fifth Element, whose properties
are yet undiscovered.
EMARILLION
A book, in mint condition, with parchment pages and a red leather binding.
All events are instantly and expertly transcribed into this elegant tome, regardless
of where and when they took place. Thus, those who hold the book have access to
the whole universe’s history, but the information is so dense that few can tolerate
processing more than one or two paragraphs – book appears to choose who is allowed
to read it, and can be quite picky about it!
Nevertheless, ancient archivists still deemed it wise to hide the book at the edge of
space and time, or so their descendants claim…
EYE OF AWAKENING
An irregular gem, no bigger than a pebble.
This tiny emerald gem can awaken a dormant ability hidden in the memories of its
owner. When the artifact is triggered it lodges in the user’s forehead, forming the eye
of wisdom (or third eye) and granting access to hidden memories.
Accessing these long-sealed memories is the equivalent of a Spiritism Ritual of
extreme power: the gem’s owner gains a Heroic Skill among those normally available
to one of the Classes they have mastered. Some even say that the Eye once belonged
to the Tiara of Control – nobody knows what kind of power the two artifacts might
have if they were combined.

LANTERN OF DISCOVERY
A small glass lantern that holds an undying flame.
Some speak of a small bronze and glass lantern jealously kept within an ancient
library, whose name was lost to time. For centuries, the lantern’s power has endured,
allowing the understanding of any text or glyph bathed in its light: one must only
place a hand on it to see a translation appear in the shape of small dancing flames.
Nobody knows what fuel the lantern uses and if it is actually inextinguishable. All that
is known for sure is that the magic light has never faltered, always showing the true
meaning of any word or symbol it shines upon, revealing truths that have led more
than one person to make terrible choices.
MIRROR OF APPEARANCES
A portable gold mirror with an iridescent surface.
The owner of the mirror can freely change their features, becoming identical to
another person. It has been used by assassins, courtiers, and power-hungry tyrants,
and some believe that this small artifact has caused more wars than entire hordes of
fiends and demons.
However, some centuries ago, this artifact vanished from all reports, apart from the
claims of some peddlers and antiquarians who swear to have found it – if any of them
were right, the world may be yet again on the brink of chaos…
ORICHALCUM CHESS
A richly engraved chess board with 6 orichalcum statuettes.
Well protected by its prestigious ebony case, this heavy chessboard may seem a mere
collector’s item, only sporting 6 pieces forged from indestructible orichalcum. However,
once the owner has tied their essence to the board – using a Ritualism Ritual with
individual area of effect and extreme power – they may then set each piece atop the
board, which will cause it to grow into a creature ready to serve the artifact’s owner.
Legends say that none of this artifact’s masters has ever succeeded in summoning
more than one piece at a time. Moreover, the only pieces whose properties are known
are the Knight (a fierce and agile fighter) and the Queen (a potent witch).
86
W
RED LION KEY
An old, engraved key decorated with a lion’s head.
This unique key is forged from fire-red metal and can be used in any lock as a universal
master key. A door opened with this powerful artifact will lead to a spacious and
majestic hall surrounded by countless doors. The hall is protected by magic and can
be used as a safe resting place. While you are there, invisible servants bring delicious
food and heal the wounded.
The only way to leave the hall is to open one of the side doors with the key itself.
Doing so functions similarly to an Entropism Ritual requiring no Mind Points but
with a Difficulty Level that depends on how hidden or well-known the destination is.
Finally, any items left in the hall will not be found upon return.
SOULPIERCING SPECTACLES
Very large glasses with wide, round lenses.
The thin, metallic gray lenses in this pair of glasses starkly contrast with the heavy
ice-colored frame. The wearer can use a Skill action to look at a living creature and
learn everything about it: its abilities, history, and objectives – even its darkest and
most embarrassing secrets will be revealed in images and words! If the creature has
an NPC profile, the Game Master should show it to the PCs in its entirety.
However, an alien presence twists and turns within the lenses’ reflections. Each use
of the spectacles lets the entity extend its thoughts and ambitions into this world,
searching hungrily for something – it’s unclear what the creature is and what will
happen when it reaches its goals.
TIARA OF CONTROL
A tiara of white gold, set with three diamonds that emit multicolored lights.
Stories say that this splendid tiara was forged by an ancient, tyrannical god who came
close to stealing free will from all living beings. Time has long forgotten the names
of those who prevented this from happening and some even maintain that it was the
artifact itself that defied its maker.
Whoever wears this legendary tiara can control the minds of living beings. However,
the awful truth is that the ancient deity still dwells within its jewels. After repeated
uses, the being can substitute its consciousness for the wearer’s, sealing their soul
within one of its shining gems.

CHAPTER
TIME WAND
A thirty-centimeter metal wand that emits a strange ticking sound…
When you grasp this powerful artifact and point it at an object or living being, you can
move the target back and forth through time, without shifting its location. The effect is
equal to that of an Entropism Ritual of extreme power and large area of effect, which
doesn’t require Mind Points – the Magic Check is performed as usual.
If the wand is used on a living being, its effects vanish after about one day. Oddly, the
lower part of this artifact seems to have a hook of some sort – could it have been part
of a larger machine?
TIMEBREAKER BRACERS
This gold and silver glove channels the power of lighting into tiny sparks.
This finely decorated artifact dates from a forgotten time and is constantly surrounded
by an Entropic magic aura. Whoever wears it can use an action to create a semitransparent
sphere around which dozens of small bolts rotate counterclockwise. The
sphere can surround up to two creatures within short distance of each other, one of
which must be the wearer. Time outside the sphere stops for a handful of seconds –
long enough to perform a single Check, or for each creature inside to perform one
action during a conflict.
Every activation of this artifact taxes the wearer’s energy: they permanently lose 5
Hit Points and 5 Mind Points. In addition, the artifact overheats after use and can’t be
reused until the end of the scene.
WINE OF SORROW
A crystal jar containing a thick, blood-red liquor.
This deadly and delicious liquor shatters and breaks the body and mind of anyone who
drinks it, after which they vanish in a puff of purple spiritual energy. It’s so potent that it
tears the soul away from the eternal flow, dissolving it forever. Though it may seem an
ideal assassination tool, the liquid stirs and moves away from any who would not drink
it consciously – which would defy the purpose.
Undeterred by the wine’s terrible effects, some would do anything for a single drop
of it: legends say that if someone lives through the agony of drinking it, they become
godlike, immune to pain and unbound by the weight of emotions. But, in 500 years, no
one has survived…

This chapter focuses on the creation and growth of high fantasy Player Characters
– you’ll need to pair it with the Press Start chapter of the Core Rulebook (from
page 145). All the options contained here are designed to be compatible with those
presented in other Atlases. When deciding which additional mechanics to include in
your Fabula Ultima JRPG campaigns, the whole group should consider what fits the
story and the needs of all who participate – take good care of your play experience!
The chapter contains two main sections:
HIGH FANTASY HEROES
Here you will find tips and suggestions for Players who are about to create a character
and play in a high fantasy campaign – there are also several examples of PCs that
make use of the high fantasy rules and options presented in the following pages.
NEW OPTIONS
Here you will find new mechanics designed for high fantasy PCs but compatible with
any Fabula Ultima campaign:
 Custom weapons. New rules for making strange and unusual weapons.
 High fantasy Quirks. New high fantasy style mechanics that enrich and give depth to
different facets of your characters.
 Zero Powers. A new method to make your characters extremely strong, capable of
breezing through most normal challenges.
 New Classes. 4 new Classes to make your characters even more high fantasy: the
musical Chanter, the synergy-oriented Commander, the versatile Dancer, and the
creative Symbolist.
 New Heroic Skills. 24 new Heroic Skills that augment the options of the Core
Rulebook and provide power-ups and support for the Classes introduced in this Atlas.

HIGH FANTASY HEROES
High fantasy heroes can be highly diverse, as are the motivations that spur them to
action. However, you should consider some essential premises before playing a group
of heroes focused on this genre.
High fantasy is such a broad and widespread concept that most Fabula Ultima
characters will take up some or all of its features sooner or later. You might end up
creating high fantasy characters even when you’re not focusing on the themes that
define them, thanks to their vast presence in the JRPGs you might reference.
EMBODY AND DEVELOP A THEME
The core of a high fantasy character is the motif they embody, represented by the
Theme written on their sheet and their overall role in the story. Each member of the
play group is responsible for highlighting specific plot and setting elements, shifting
the spotlight between different features of the world and its inhabitants.
 A guiding light. Your high fantasy character’s actions, thoughts, and words are
intensely imbued with their Themes. That doesn’t mean they must be overly theatrical
or affected, just full of meaning.
 Looks. The looks of high fantasy characters often make them easy to read: a dark
knight clad in black armor, a brave warrior wielding her giant sword, a priest with
pristine robes, and so on. However, it can be interesting to create tension and
contrast between a character’s looks and their demeanor or motivations – this adds
depth, which is always a good thing. Of course, the same goes for the antagonists.
 A reflection of the world. When you choose Themes for your characters, these
become cornerstones of the game world. The Game Master should connect at least
one Villain to your Themes, which will help you to explore them through tensions
and conflicts during play.
 Change. Though choosing a Theme matters, don’t be afraid to change it. On the
contrary, doing so will be an intense, all-absorbing act of growth for your character,
one that you should not ignore. For example, changing your Theme after Surrendering
might indicate a profound loss of faith – which you should properly portray during a
scene – while moving from Guilt to Hope should signal a crucial change in how your
character views the world.

CHAPTER
BONDS AND FEELINGS
Passions, even if not of the romantic kind, are ever present in high fantasy stories.
The protagonists are driven by strong emotions towards allies, enemies, places, and
factions. Familiar tropes include rivalry that develops into friendship, loss of faith
following a mentor’s betrayal, and encounters with communities and cultures distant
from one’s own.
The optional rules for Starting Bonds (Core Rulebook, page 220) work well in most
high fantasy campaigns.
Instead of avoiding intense, complicated, and apparently contradictory feelings, try
to focus on them intentionally, but always remember the needs and preferences of
other group members. The goal, as always, is for everyone to have a better experience
with the game.
STYLE AND LOOKS
Whether we consider clothing, weapons, or magical powers, a high fantasy protagonist
needs iconic style and looks which make them impossible to miss. This chapter
contains several optional rules to give your game a high fantasy tone, which you can
adapt to provide the visual effect you are going for.
For example, the Zero Remedy power (page 127) could manifest as a host of angels,
a great urn pouring healing waters on your allies, or a wave of energy radiating from
the hero’s heart. Though these descriptions may seem mere decorations, they are what
makes each hero unique and unforgettable.
SAMPLE HIGH FANTASY CHARACTERS
The following pages provide profiles for ten Player Characters designed for high
fantasy contexts. In contrast to the new Classic Characters (page 132), these examples
focus on the thematic construction of the heroes and provide some tips on how to
grow these characters and their role in the story.
All characters in the following pages use the optional rules for Quirks (page 114) and
some have Custom Weapons (page 106).

O
 Agnes is the last descendant of the Grimoire Guardians, an ancient
family devoted to collecting, cataloguing, and hiding dangerous
magical tomes. She is also believed to be the Red Guardian – since
birth, Agnes’s destiny has been to retrieve the seven fairytale
grimoires and use the legends told within to bind the oblivion drake
Níðhöggr when he inevitably awakens.
 Agnes’s childhood friend Callen accompanied her in the search for
the first grimoire, but he lost his life in the battle against the monster
who guarded it. Driven by fear of failing her Duty and her family’s
expectations, Agnes linked Callen’s spirit to her own to save his life:
a partially self-serving choice, which she is yet to come to terms with.
 Agnes is an Arcanist and Elementalist. The group discussed Arcana in
their game, and decided that each new Arcana Agnes binds will take the
shape of a grimoire containing appropriate stories.
 The Game Master should ask Agnes’s Player for input whenever the
traditions or legends of the Guardians come up in a scene.
 Agnes’s mission will be central to the campaign –
perhaps even too much! Her Player should ensure
that she doesn’t steal the spotlight, and make sure
to give other characters time to shine.

becoming a pioneer of the magitech arts.
 Callen’s Classes are Tinkerer, Guardian, and Weaponmaster, focusing
on the Dual Shieldbearer Skill – despite using the standard rules, his
shields look like massive gauntlets. He also relies on Counterattack
and Infusions to deal heavy damage.
 Since Callen and Agnes are both from the Kingdom of Argus, their Players
will collaborate in fleshing out details about this place during play.
 The biggest challenge for Callen’s Player is to avoid
getting stuck in the role of Agnes’s protector – the other
Players should make sure to interact with him,
offering him ample chances for narrative development.

Orchestral claymore
O
 Estrella is a multiversal idol lost in this world after she fell through
a dimensional portal that appeared in the City of Sigils, where she
was born and raised. Though she may never return home, Estrella has
not lost her heart and has joined a group of heroes with the Hope
of discovering a new portal. Between adventures, Estrella seeks
inspiration for her songs.
 Estrella’s Player chose a signature custom weapon called orchestral
claymore: a heavy weapon that grants a bonus to Accuracy Checks
and Magic Defense. The blade of this weapon vibrates in sync with
Estrella’s voice.
 Estrella is a hothead with no qualms about being direct and outspoken.
Her Classes are Chanter and Fury.
 Though she may initially appear as a “light-hearted” and over the top
character, Estrella is lost in an unknown world where she may be stuck
forever: the Game Master should introduce other characters who “have
lost their way home”, to give Estrella a chance for narrative growth.
 Creatures much less inclined to kindness than Estrella
might also find their way through other portals all
around the game world – a worthy threat indeed!

Identity: Disciple of the

Origin: Temple of
the Four Peaks
Quirk: Flight
Signature weapons: Bows
 Grimm is a Disciple of the Four Peaks. After years of training, he is now
tasked with traveling the world and helping those in need, regardless of
who they are and what their past sins might be. Like many inhabitants
of the Four Peaks, Grimm is Aliseid – a winged human.
 Grimm’s Mercy channels his training at the Temple of the Four Peaks.
Still, his people have a history of bloodshed – confident in their power
of Flight, the Aliseidian winged forces struck fear in the region for
centuries. Fortunately, a pacifist school of thought has taken root
during the last few decades, calling for the sharing and preservation of
goods as well as knowledge.
 Grimm is a Symbolist, a Sharpshooter, and a Wayfarer. His skill with
the bow lets him apply symbols at a distance, though he prefers to use
them to protect his allies.
 The Game Master should involve Grimm’s Player when defining plot
elements about the traditions of the Four Peaks and the many people
connected to the temple.
 Someone still wishes to bring the Four Peaks back to their
warmongering traditions – perhaps Grimm will someday
return home to face threats from the past.

KEPLER DRAC
BASIC INFORMATION
KEPLER IN DETAIL
O
 Kepler is the Exile Princess of Drachenheim, land of draconians amidst
the mountains. She left her homeland after a coup by her uncle and
younger sister, Karsten, towards whom Kepler feels an intense thirst
for Vengeance.
 During her flight, Kepler stole the Second Blade of Drachenheim, a
transforming custom weapon which has two forms: “sheathed” (+2 to
both Defenses) and “unsheathed” (accurate and powerful). Obtained
via the Heirloom Quirk, this weapon is rare: each form deals 4 extra
damage and makes its wielder immune to the shaken status effect.
Karsten still holds the First Blade of Drachenheim – the wielder of
both blades would be the legitimate heir to the Dragon Throne.
 Kepler is a keen strategist and arcane fencer – her Classes are
Commander, Elementalist, and Weaponmaster.
 The Game Master should ask Kepler’s Player to chip in with information
about Drachenheim and any legends related to dragons and wyverns.
 The climax of Kepler’s narrative arc will likely be the clash
with her sister, where the hero may yet renounce her
desire for vengeance – or make one last sacrifice.

LILIM IN DETAIL
O
 Men and women from the Sacred Land of Lathran are often wed to
demons, forcing them to appear and obey. When Lilim volunteered for
the rite, his bride turned out to be the Queen of Demons, Decarabia.
Incapable of truly binding her power, the priests tried to banish her by
killing Lilim instead, but the demon protected him and then disappeared.
 Lilim wields the sacred chains which bind him to Decarabia, but he
rarely takes to the field directly: instead, he relies on Lævateinn, a
colossal, intelligent fiery sword that follows him around – a gift from
the queen before she vanished.
 Lilim’s Classes are Spiritist and Wayfarer. His sword Lævateinn is an
elemental Faithful Companion whose fiery humor balances out Lilim’s
brooding demeanor.
 Lilim’s Doubt and his Fettered Heart Quirk are tied to his internal
struggles: though raised in a society that detests demons, he was
betrayed by those he trusted, and defended by the very being he had
sworn to fight.
 The Game Master should focus on creating tensions
between humans and demons, building up to the
inevitable climax when Lilim and Decarabia find
themselves face to face.

 The revenant paladin Morrigan returned to life a long time after her
demise in a body she did not know, which once belonged to Roza, a
young woman slain during the latest Federate offensive. Morrigan has
no memory of who or what took her from the agonizing limbo in which
she dwelled, but the sight of a world still torn by wars so many years
after her death fills her with Anger.
 The magical realm of Avalon is now a mere legend, but Morrigan still
remembers it well. Sadly, she also remembers its tragic downfall and
her failure to protect Prince Cormac, the man she loved.
 Morrigan has a split, conflicted nature: her Classes are Darkblade
and Spiritist.
 Morrigan’s Player should be the go-to person for all information
relating to Avalon’s lore, its culture, and its ancient, powerful magic.
 Morrigan begins her tale racked with resentment – the group has
already agreed on how dark and gruesome her scenes could be.

to help create opportunities for the tormented knight
to discover the value of Mercy.

Signature weapons:
Giant Shuriken
 Pavel is a fugitive ninja from the Ocean Clans. They hail from Venize,
a seaborn metropolis dominated by mercenary guilds that make pacts
with elemental spirits in exchange for special powers. Pavel gained
their Quirk through this process – it allows them to manipulate water
and ice at the cost of being Vulnerable to bolt damage.
 The Belonging Theme channels Pavel’s rejection of family and home
– where they are seen as a mere tool – and the search for people
ready to love and appreciate them for who they are, not just because
of their powers.
 Pavel fights with giant shuriken, custom two-handed thrown
weapons that double as shields (defense boost, magic defense boost,
powerful). Their Classes are Sharpshooter and Wayfarer, which offer
good flexibility.
 The Game Master should ask Pavel’s Player for details about Venize,
the ocean, the mercenary guilds, and the elemental spirits involved in
their pacts.

feigns kindness and understanding but manipulates
and sacrifices people when they cease to be of use.

 Rainer is a charming rogue and skilled fencer, besides being a gambler,
waltz and tango dancer, airship pilot, smuggler, and – of course! –
paramour of all three young dutchesses De La Foix. Rainer Veddick is
all this and much more… or so he claims. To the rest of the world, he’s
just a crook with a two-week life expectancy.
 Rainer seems cursed: things go downhill anytime he opens his mouth,
and his presence often puts people on guard. Though his Theme is
Justice, it’s unlikely that his personal view of right and wrong will
find much purchase.
 Rainer is a Rogue, Dancer, and Weaponmaster – a flexible play style
based around dual-wielding weapons to inflict status effects.
 The Game Master should ask Rainer’s Player for information about the
criminal underworld and the trade marquisate of Yssira, which is rich in
perils and opportunities.
 Rainer might seem like a “simple” antihero character, but
this is just the start of his tale. In the future, an unexpected
power might awaken within him… or not. Maybe Rainer
is just an average guy who needs a chance to prove
his heroism.

Identity: Balance Sorceress
Theme: Understanding

Origin: Belmonte
Quirk: Ruinbringer
Signature weapons: Staves
 Raisa is a balance sorceress – someone whose spirit sits on the line
between positive and negative magic – who, having lost her parents,
was raised by her grandfather in a hamlet called Belmonte.
 Raisa is just starting her journey and is sometimes scared of her powers.
She yearns to understand the nature of her magic as well as that of the
Nine-Tailed Fox, the mighty witch whose blood flows through young
Raisa’s veins – thus the Ruinbringer Quirk.
 Raisa is an Elementalist, Entropist, and Spiritist. Her Player has
decided to develop the three Classes based on what happens session
after session: tragic or harsh events will feed the Elementalist and
Entropist, while hope and kindness will nourish her Spiritist side.
 The Game Master should ask Raisa’s Player for details about Belmonte,
the ancient magic tradition of balance sorceresses, and the mystery
surrounding the Nine-Tailed Fox.
 Together, the rest of the group should work towards becoming a new
family for Raisa, helping her to accept her powers and face

From here on, the chapter focuses on new options and rules designed to enhance
the high fantasy vibes of your Fabula Ultima campaign. However, if the whole group
agrees, you can use these options for any campaign.
These introductory pages provide preliminary information about the various options,
in terms of both mechanics and play experience, to help you identify the most
interesting ones for your game.
CUSTOM WEAPONS
You can use this rule to make unusual weapons.
It’s a simple and straightforward option with
no profound gameplay implications – you
can always leave it open to anyone who
is interested.
HIGH FANTASY QUIRKS
This option is more complex and
has a significant effect on character
creation. If you use it, each Player
Character will gain a set of unique
mechanics defining their abilities
and role in the story.
The effects are powerful, ranging
from flying to using Fabula Points
for spellcasting.
Use Quirks if you are comfortable
setting aside the power balance
between characters in favor of strong
characterization. This option works best
in tight and collaborative groups and may
be too complex if this is your first experience
with the game.

ZERO POWERS
This is likely the most “explosive” rule in this book: Zero Powers allow each Player
Character to unleash incredible effects when they are cornered – far in excess of
anything else in the game.
Some of these powers will let you unleash a barrage of attacks, heal all your allies, or
cast powerful spells for free.
Using this option, you can rely on your heroes coming out on top in most conflicts – it’s
excellent for a superhero-style story or casual play.
NEW CLASSIC CHARACTERS
These sample high fantasy builds expand on those provided in the Core Rulebook
(page 172), expressing the full potential of this Atlas’ new Classes. You will also find
two premade Groups to draw inspiration from – one features characters sharing a
common Class, the other with greater variety.
“First of all, decide what you wish to create.
Only then shall you grasp your brushes and paints.”
NEW CLASSES
This Atlas introduces four new Classes for Player Characters. They
are designed to interact normally with those found within the Core
Rulebook and other expansions without needing modifications. The
following pages also contain some practical tips for Players and
Game Masters about using these new Classes.
NEW HEROIC SKILLS
This last, lengthy section contains twenty-four new Heroic Skills. Some
are tied to the new Classes from this Atlas, but most add options for
those found in the Core Rulebook. Notably, these pages present new
Heroic Skills tied to each Category of melee and ranged weapons, which
provides more extensive characterization options to Weaponmasters
and Sharpshooters.

CHANTER
 A Chanter has access to a wide variety of support powers, from Hit Point and Mind
Point recovery to changing damage type and even increasing Attributes. For a Game
Master, creating an exciting conflict for a Chanter means first taking note of how they
can manipulate the scene.
 The Chanter’s abilities are less potent than those of the other Classes, but they have
fixed costs and affect all enemies or allies automatically – the more characters that
are in play, the more effective the Chanter is.
 Chanters are often celebrities, or at least well-known figures, which can be both
a blessing and a curse. Also, don’t forget to have the Chanter explain how show
business works in your game world!
COMMANDER
 This is likely the most challenging Class to play effectively in all of Fabula Ultima:
like any true leader, the Commander’s strength depends on that of their comrades. If
a Player chooses this Class for their character, it is crucial for the rest of the group to
cooperate in creating characters that synergize well with the Commander’s.
 You can significantly increase the offensive potential of your group by combining the
Queen’s Gambit and Charging Cavalry Skills. Charging Cavalry can also be used on
NPCs, up to and including a Faithful Companion (Core Rulebook, page 217).
 Bishop’s Edict and King’s Castle affect friends and foes alike. Timing and coordination
are vital in using these Skills effectively without paying a steep price, and the Game
Master should plan conflicts in which careful use of these powers can shine.
 Though Commanders can be of many types, they all share the idea of leading allies in
battle. Thus, it’s extremely important to flesh out the character’s past, including their
role in the wars and conflicts that shaped the game world up until today.

DANCER
 The Dancer is a versatile Class that can help you to create fighters and casters with
full access to all elemental combinations… at the cost of an ongoing Mind Point
expense. The Game Master should always carefully consider each Dancer’s specific
abilities when designing conflicts.
 Do not be fooled by the name of this Class: the Dancer’s abilities can manifest in a
myriad ways, such as acrobatic martial arts, fencing stances, or even performance
poses. What truly defines the aesthetics of the character’s powers is the combination
with their Identity and other Classes!
 Dancing usually has deep cultural meaning – the Game Master and the Dancer’s
Player should define what that means in the setting, especially if the character’s
dances have a sacred or religious meaning.
SYMBOLIST
 The Symbolist is a Class with many options, though it works best in a supportive role.
Notably, it is one of the few Classes whose Skills endure after the scene has ended:
symbols normally have unlimited life unless removed by their maker or destroyed by
a Villain during a Game Master scene (see page 148).
 A Symbolist who selects the Ritual Seals Heroic Skill (page 159) gains an
unprecedented power: the ability to pre-cast a Ritual and release its effect at a later
time. This powerful option will likely inject creativity and lateral thinking into the
game. However, remember to perform the Magic Check when the Ritual triggers – it’s
not a foolproof ability!
 You can use the Symbolist Class to represent a great variety of character archetypes:
painters, sculptors, rune crafters, calligraphers, and more. Whatever the Symbolist’s
chosen art form, their Player should discuss its role in the world with the Game Master.

A majority of JRPG protagonists wield unique weapons that reflect their style and are
an expression of their personality – from battle umbrellas to gun axes, nothing should
be considered too impractical!
The following rules allow you to create a custom weapon for your hero during character
creation. Later on, the Game Master can create rare versions of these weapons as per
the normal rules in the Core Rulebook (page 268; you can find sample rare custom
weapons in the following pages).
Custom weapons aren’t necessarily better than normal basic weapons – choose what
to use based on what fits your personal vision of the character.
CREATING A CUSTOM WEAPON
A custom weapon starts with the following characteristics:
 It belongs to one Category of your choice (arcane, bow, brawling, dagger, firearm,
flail, heavy, spear, sword or thrown).
 It is not a martial weapon (E), but might become one depending on the customizations
that are chosen for it (see below).
 It is a two-handed weapon and cannot benefit from the Monkey Grip Heroic Skill (Core
Rulebook, page 238); in short, a custom weapon will always occupy both hand slots.
 It is a melee weapon or a ranged weapon (your choice, and regardless of the Category
you previously chose for it).
 It has a cost of 300 zenit.
 Its Accuracy Check relies on【 DEX + INS】 o【r DEX + MIG】 (your choice).
 It deals physical damage equal to【 HR + 5】.
A custom weapon also receives three customizations from the list on the right.
 Each customization can only be chosen once for the same custom weapon.
 Choosing a customization marked with E turns the weapon into a martial weapon.
 If a customization says “you”, it refers to the character who has the weapon equipped.
 Some especially powerful customizations count as two customizations or increase
the cost of the custom weapon.

CHAPTER
CUSTOMIZATIONS
Accurate
Adds a +2 bonus to the weapon’s Accuracy Check formula.
Defense Boost
You gain a +2 bonus to Defense, and you are treated as having a shield equipped for
the sake of your Skills (for instance, Defensive Mastery or Dodge; see Core Rulebook,
page 197 and 203).
Elemental
Choose air, bolt, dark, earth, fire, ice, light or poison. The weapon now deals damage
of the chosen type instead of physical, and also deals 2 extra damage.
Magic Defense Boost E
You gain a +2 bonus to Magic Defense.
Powerful E
The weapon deals 5 extra damage, or 7 extra damage if it is a heavy weapon.
This customization is not available for arcane and dagger weapons, or for weapons
with the quick customization (see below).
Quick (counts as two customizations) E
When you perform the Attack action and choose to attack with this weapon, you may
perform two attacks (against the same target or against different targets). If you do,
both attacks follow the rules for two-weapon fighting (Core Rulebook, page 69).
Transforming (increases the custom weapon’s cost by 100 zenit)
This weapon has a second form, which must be designed as a separate custom weapon,
must have the transforming customization, and doesn’t cost you any zenit.
While you have one of the two forms equipped, you can equip the other form whenever
you want; during a conflict scene, you can only do so during your turn, before or after
an action, and only once per turn.
If one or both the forms are martial (E), remember that you must have the appropriate
Classes to equip them. Additionally, a transforming weapon can still only have one
Quality (the Quality applies to both forms).
108
W
COMPATIBILITY
Custom weapons allow you to create the most bizarre armaments you can imagine: and
at the same time, efforts were made to keep them somewhat balanced. For instance,
one might argue that a quick and accurate custom weapon is always better than a
pair of steel daggers, but there is a loss in flexibility by being unable to combine that
dagger with a different weapon – there’s pros and cons to each choice.
TRANSFORMING WEAPONS
The transforming customization is by far the most complex option provided by custom
weapons. One important note, however: if one form of your weapon is a melee weapon
and the other is a ranged weapon, or if they belong to different Categories, you only
gain the benefits of one form at a time.
For instance, if you use a weapon with a melee form and a ranged form, you won’t be
able to add both Powerful Shot and Powerful Strike to damage, or to Counterattack
while simultaneously having Crossfire available.
A character wielding a transforming weapon is always free to decide which form they
start with at the beginning of a conflict.
SAMPLE HIGH FANTASY CUSTOM WEAPONS
The following pages showcase a few examples of high fantasy-style custom weapons,
accompanied by possible rare evolutions. The following conditions apply:
 You may never wield a custom weapon in a single hand, not even decreasing its
damage by 4 as indicated on page 268 of the Core Rulebook.
 When it comes to transforming weapons, any modification (extra damage, Qualities,
Accuracy bonuses...) is automatically applied to both forms.
Sometimes, a Player Character’s custom weapon will also be something they hold dear
(especially if it was obtained through the Heirloom Quirk, found on page 120). In that
case, it can be a good idea to describe later rare variants as “upgrades” of the initial
weapon, instead of completely different items (for instance, they might be described
as gems slotted inside a sword, or unique cartridges for a firearm). However, the rules
and mechanics that govern items and equipment should not be altered.

Quirks are an advanced optional rule that provides strong thematic and mechanical
options for Player Characters. The Quirks presented in these pages were written with
a High Fantasy assumption, but may be used in any campaign. You may also use them
as reference to create your own Quirks – but you should only do so if the rest of your
group agrees to it.
 A Player Character may only ever have one Quirk.
 If you use Quirks in your game, it is strongly suggested that each Player Character
begins play with one. Additionally, no two characters in the same group should have
identical Quirks.
 On average, a group of Player Characters with access to Quirks will be able to tackle
more challenging situations than what would be normal for their level.
 If it makes sense in the story, a character may lose their current Quirk and gain a
different one – discuss this with the group.
USING QUIRKS IN YOUR GAME
Quirks should be seen as a mechanical and narrative reinforcement of your characters’
unique nature. Keep the following in mind:
 Quirks shape the game. Even the less impactful Quirk is a powerful statement about
your character and their role in the story. If you pick Heirloom, you don’t just get
“a cool sword” – you get an item with implications. If you pick Glorious Fate, the
prophecy will become a major part of the game. Quirks will take the already heroic
Player Characters and kick them up a notch, which can be prove a bit overwhelming.
Think carefully before you use them!
 Freedom of choice. You don’t need a Quirk for your character concept to be valid. If
your Identity is that of a “Heroine from the Past”, you shouldn’t feel forced to pick
From a Distant World for that Identity to be relevant to the story.
 How to use Quirks. These options should be used to bring interesting situations into
play, to give your character unique issues and problems to confront, and to provide
additional mechanical support for their Traits.
 How not to use Quirks. These options should never be used to make your character
stronger than the rest of the group, to steal the spotlight, or to bring sensitive topics
that make others uncomfortable into play.

CHAPTER
d ARBOREAL
You are a sentient plant creature with humanoid intelligence. Are you the result of
a magical experiment, or do you belong to a particular species? Do you resemble
a specific type of plant, flower, or tree? What is your relationship with other plant
creatures, and with the woods and forests of this world?
Choose a status effect: dazed, enraged, or shaken. You are immune to the chosen
status effect. However, you also become Vulnerable to a damage type of your choice:
air, bolt, earth, fire, or ice.
You also learn one NPC spell (pages 310-311 of the Core Rulebook), but you cannot
choose Devastation. If a Magic Check is required, use【 INS + WLP】. Customize the
spell as needed (name, damage type, status effects etc.). When you cast this spell while
in sunlight, its total MP cost is reduced by 5 (to a minimum of 0 Mind Points).
d CURSED
You bear the burden of a strange curse. Through which supernatural effects does
it manifest? How did you become cursed? Was it a stroke of bad luck, or a form of
punishment for something you did? How can the curse be lifted?
When you acquire this Quirk, describe the nature of your curse and tie it to one of
the threats present in your world. Once this threat is resolved, you will finally have a
chance to break free from the curse – describe how you expect this to happen.
Examples: weapons you wield often miss their mark; your mere presence instills a
sense of dread; your magic has a tendency to trigger unitended results; creatures
within arm’s reach of you feel sharp pain across their bodies.
When you are about to perform a Check, you may instead describe how your curse
gets in the way and automatically roll a fumble (both dice are treated as if you had
rolled a 1 on them). If you do, you receive 2 Fabula Points instead of 1, and generate
an opportunity as normal.
If you ever manage to break the curse, immediately gain a Heroic Skill of your choice
(you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless
they include a Skill you don’t have). This includes choosing a Heroic Skill for a Class
you do not have.
116
W
d ELEMENTAL SOUL
You are deeply infused with the power of a natural element. Are you the child of an
elemental creature, or did you join souls with some kind of spirit? Who might try to
take advantage of your unique nature? Who is afraid of you?
Choose your elemental damage type: air, bolt, earth, fire, or ice. You gain Resistance
to the chosen damage type. Additionally, whenever you deal damage, you may change
its type so that it matches your elemental damage type. However, you also become
Vulnerable to a different damage type chosen among those five.
You also gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Elementalism discipline, but only if
those Rituals manipulate your chosen element (respectively air, electricity, earth/rock,
fire, and ice/water).
d EMPTY HANDS
You have forsaken the use of weapons, instead purely relying on your hands and feet.
Did you develop this fighting style out of necessity, or was it a choice? Is it because of
your monstrous anatomy? Did your blade take one too many lives in the past?
Your attacks with unarmed strikes deal 6 extra damage. This amount increases to 10
extra damage if you are level 30 or higher.
Additionally, while you have no weapons or shields equipped (aside for unarmed
strikes), you gain a +1 bonus to Defense and a +1 bonus to Magic Defense.
W
Many Quirks bring complex themes to your table: for instance, Fettered Heart
can introduce topics such as gaslighting and repression; From a Distant World
may imply xenophobia and discrimination; Glorious Fate can lead to strong
social pressure and expectations; and Cursed or Ruinbringer may color your
games with tragedy. Even simpler options such as Elemental Soul or Flight
might make it so a character is treated as “not entirely human” by society. When
you choose and customize your Quirks, commit to respecting the personal
boundaries of those who play with you. Use lines and veils (page 140 of the
Core Rulebook) and be ready to pause the game if a scene is making someone
uncomfortable. Be kind to each other, and be kind to yourselves

CHAPTER
d FETTERED HEART
For many years you have obeyed the precepts of a certain person or authority; you
built your entire existence upon them. Now, however, you begin to see those rules in a
darker light, and your heart falters. When did you first doubt them?
You may acquire this Quirk only if your character’s Theme is Doubt, and your Theme
cannot be changed in any way as long as you have this Quirk.
When you acquire this Quirk, create a Bond towards the Non-Player Character or
institution that shaped your life up to now. This Bond begins with three emotions of
your choice, and cannot be lost or erased in any way as long as you have this Quirk
(you can still reassign its emotions during Resting scenes). Additionally, create three
commandments that are crucial to that NPC or institution: each commandment must
be something you must always do or something you must never do.
Examples: the Lord of Dragons (always obey a dragon, never show your weakness,
never extinguish fire); the Pale Church (always side with the faithful, never doubt the
word of a Priest, never lend your ear to a demon).
The first time you break a commandment during each scene, you immediately suffer
the shaken and weak status effects and lose half your current Hit Points and Mind
Points (rounded down), but also gain 2 Fabula Points.
If you break a commandement during a Resting scene, you will suffer the penalties
after the recovery granted by that Rest. If you break multiple commandments during
the same scene, the penalties and Fabula Points only apply to the first violation.
After breaking your commandments 6 times, ignore any further violation unless it
happens in the presence of a Villain who follows or embodies your commandments.
If you’re ever unsure whether a situation fits the criteria of this Quirk, it is you who
always have final say. Be as honest and sincere as you can.
Upon your 7th violation, you lose this Quirk and change your Theme to one of the
following: Belonging, Guilt, Justice or Vengeance. Then, you immediately gain a
Heroic Skill among those available for your Classes (you may even choose a Heroic
Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don’t
have). Finally, you recover all HP and MP and recover from all status effects. From
now on, the strength of your Bonds is always treated as being 1 point higher (for
instance, a Bond with three emotions will have a strength of 4).
118
W
d FLIGHT
You belong to a unique heritage of humanoids who have the ability to fly or levitate.
How does this work? Is it magical, or do you have wings? How did this particular
advantage shape the history and society of your people? How do people usually
react to seeing you?
You are able to fly. In addition to the obvious advantage in mobility, your melee attacks
can target flying creatures and you cannot be targeted by melee attacks unless the
attacker is flying or is somehow able to reach flying targets.
While in Crisis or unable to fly freely (such as when you’re inside a vehicle designed
for human-sized creatures or in a narrow corridor), you lose all benefits granted by this
Quirk. Additionally, when you suffer air, bolt or ice damage during a conflict scene, you
lose the benefits of this Quirk until the start of your next turn.
W
d FROM A DISTANT WORLD
Your presence here is an anomaly, an
unexpected knot in the weave of destiny:
the rules of this land sometimes fail to
bind you. Do you come from a different
planet, or perhaps a different time? How did
you get here, and when? Do you think you
still have a chance to go back, and would you
do so? What terrible threat followed you?
When you participate in a conflict
scene, you automatically gain 1
Fabula Point. Additionally, you can
invoke a Trait to reroll dice even if
you fumbled your Check (if you do
so, you do not receive a Fabula
Point for the fumble).

CHAPTER
d GLORIOUS FATE
There is a prophecy surrounding you, a prophecy of hope for a better world. Who
spoke or wrote that prophecy? Do you embrace your destiny, or are you crushed by its
weight? Did someone plant seeds of doubt in your heart?
When you acquire this Quirk, write down the prophecy, and what it foretold. Do this
with the collaboration of everyone else in the group, tie it to a known threat or
emergency in your world, and describe what sign or omen marks you as the person
supposedly destined to fulfill that prophecy.
Examples: “The boy with the ruby necklace will bring back water to the Desolate
Plains”, or “The Branded One shall destroy the Chaos Dragon”.
At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), before assigning XP,
think carefully and honestly about what happened during the session and choose one
of the five options below. The choice is yours to make, but it’s often a good idea to talk
about what happened with the rest of the group.
 The prophecy was fulfilled: lose this Quirk, fully restore your Hit Points and Mind
Points, recover from all status effects, and gain a Heroic Skill from those available
for your Classes (you may even choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not
satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don’t have).
 You acted in accordance to the prophecy: fully restore your Hit Points and Mind
Points, and recover from all status effects.
 You acted neither in accordance to nor against the prophecy: nothing happens.
 You acted against the prophecy: gain 1 Fabula Point.
 The prophecy can never be fulfilled: lose this Quirk, gain 6 Fabula Points, and gain a
Heroic Skill from those available for your Classes (you may even choose a Heroic Skill
whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a Skill you don’t have).
Once the first or last option is chosen, the role of the prophecy in your world comes
to an end. Even if later on in the campaign it appears that a situation might match
the words of the prophecy, the effects of this Quirk will no longer be in place: you are
free to shape your destiny and act based on your inner moral compass. Or perhaps you
always were?
“It’s been a long time since I last had
the strength to struggle against my fate...”
120
W
d HEIRLOOM
You possess one or more pieces of equipment that boast unique properties. Are those
items something passed down in your family, or a gift from someone you hold dear?
What strange or dangerous rumors surround these items? Who would do anything in
their power to take them from you?
You obtain a single rare item worth 1200 zenit or less, or two rare items worth up to
800 zenit each. You may choose these items from the available lists or design them
together with the rest of your group.
Once per session (approximately four hours of play), the Game Master may give you 1
Fabula Point in order to have sudden complications arise due to the unique nature of
the item(s) you carry (such as rival duelists or strange monsters drawn by its magic).
Items acquired through this Quirk cannot be destroyed, damaged, lost or stolen
without your permission as a Player.
d OLD TRANSPORT
You own an old vehicle that you love dearly. Unfortunately, the cursed thing barely
holds together and won’t stop causing you trouble. Did you build this vehicle yourself,
or did you receive it from someone? What very specific flaw or quirk makes it unique?
What makes it extremely recognizable?
You obtain a transport of your choice from the Core Rulebook (page 125), such as a land
vehicle, a ship, or even an airship. The size of this transport is enough to accommodate
you and the rest of your group, plus two or three guests, but it is unfit for combat.
Once per session (approximately four hours of play), the Game Master can give you 2
Fabula Points in order to make the transport’s engines fail, cause an enemy missile to
damage its hull, or introduce similar story-based complications. However, the transport
can never be destroyed without your permission.
d REVENANT
You were brought back after death, unable to peacefully merge with the stream of
souls. Do you know why or how this happened? How does your undeath visually
manifest? Were you returned to your body, or displaced into a different one?
You are not considered a living creature and gain Immunity to dark damage and
poison damage, but become Vulnerable to light damage. You are also immune to the
poisoned status effect.

PROTAGONISTS
CHAPTER
You do not need to breathe, eat or drink, but you still follow the normal rules for
resting. You also recover Hit Points and recover from status effects as normal (contrary
to undead creatures, effects that restore HP cannot be used to harm you).
Finally, whenever you deal damage, you may change its type to dark. Additionally, all
dark damage you deal ignores Immunities and Resistances.
d RIVAL PRODIGIES
You possess an incredible talent, making you one of the very best in your field... too
bad you’re always one step behind your eternal rival! Who are they, and when did you
last face off against each other? Who trained you, and what expectations do they hold
about your future? What did you sacrifice to achieve this level of ability?
When you acquire this Quirk, choose what you specialize in: Rituals, Skills, or spells.
Then, say who your eternal rival is: this Non-Player Character becomes a minor
Villain (5 Ultima Points), and you create a Bond towards them, with 1 emotion chosen
between admiration and inferiority.
When a rule or ability pertaining to your specialization requires you to spend Hit Points
or Mind Points, you may spend 1 Fabula Point instead to completely ignore that cost.
However, while your rival is present on the scene and has 1 or more Ultima Points
left, any Check you fail is automatically treated as if you had rolled a 1 on both dice
and triggered a fumble (this means the Check cannot be rerolled and you immediately
gain 1 Fabula Point).
If the rival has no Ultima Points but escalates into becoming a Villain of greater strength,
they immediately recharge their Ultima Points: thus, the penalty described above will
still apply. The only way to get rid of it is for your rival to die or to stop being a Villain.
122
W
d ROBOT
You are an artificial body animated through science or magic. Do you know who
created you, and why? Is your existence a threat to someone? Are there any “copies”
of you around the world? Were you always a robot, or do you still hold memories of a
previous existence?
You are not considered a living creature and gain Immunity to poison damage and
Resistance to earth damage. You are also immune to the poisoned status effect.
You do not need to breathe, eat or drink, but you still follow the normal rules for
resting. You also recover Hit Points and recover from status effects as normal.
You gain a +2 bonus to all Checks you perform to examine or interact with machines,
technology and constructs (except for Accuracy Checks and Magic Checks).
d RUINBRINGER
You possess almost limitless power, but there is a price to it: you shall bring doom to
this world. How do you know this? Strange visions, markings that appear on your body,
or something else? What gives you hope to stop what’s coming?
When you acquire this Quirk, say which ruin you are supposed to bring into the world:
that ruin immediately becomes one of your world’s threats.
Examples: the Demon Queen, the Great Comet, the God of Bloodshed.
Until your ruin comes true, you cannot Sacrifice yourself (in fact, servants of the Ruin
might even lend you a hand and free you from any imprisonments that would prevent
you from fulfilling your role in their plans).
When a rule or ability requires you to spend Hit Points, Mind Points, or Fabula Points,
you may instead let your ruin advance to completely ignore that cost. You describe
what dark omens manifest, and the GM receives an opportunity (page 41 of the Core
Rulebook) that can be used to add complications after the current scene has ended.
At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), before assigning XP,
roll 2d20. If you roll equal to or lower than your current character level, your ruin
advances (it will always advance if you are level 40 or higher).
When your ruin advances for the 9th time, you lose this Quirk and your ruin comes
true, manifesting into the world as a supreme Villain (15 Ultima Points). However, you
immediately gain a Heroic Skill from those available for your Classes (you may even
choose a Heroic Skill whose requirements you do not satisfy, unless they include a
Skill you don’t have). Steel yourself and face your destiny.

CHAPTER
d SOULS ENTWINED
You made a magical deal with another character. You can now dwell inside their body
and physically manifest if necessary. When and why did you strike this pact? Is it part
of your people’s magical nature, or was it a desperate attempt to keep you alive? When
did it first get you into trouble?
When you acquire this Quirk, choose another Player Character to act as a host body
for your soul. You both immediately create a Bond towards each other. This Bond has
1 emotion chosen from admiration, affection and loyalty.
Make sure whoever controls the host character is okay with this and looks forward to
exploring the unique nature of this Quirk with you.
You and your host may communicate telepathically (you are considered “able to hear
each other” for the sake of Skills and effects that require it).
Outside conflict scenes, you may enter the body of your host or leave it to physically
appear at their side whenever you want. If you are ever more than 1 travel day away
from your host, you vanish and reappear at their side. During a conflict, you may enter
or leave the host’s body at the start of your turn (doing so does not require an action).
While you are within the host’s body, you cannot perceive the outside world with your
normal five senses nor physically interact with it, and the creatures outside cannot
perceive you with their normal five senses nor physically interact with you.
However, anyone who can sense the presence of souls (through Rituals or similar
supernatural abilities) will realize the host’s body contains two different souls.
You cannot enjoy the benefits of a Rest unless your host rests as well.
When you Surrender, you immediately vanish and enter the host’s body (you may
never be separated from the host as a consequence for Surrendering).
When you host Surrenders, you immediately enter their body and cannot leave it until
that character regains consciousness.
When your host Sacrifices themselves, choose one option:
 Survive: you immediately leave their body, lose this Quirk, your current Hit Points
become equal to 0, and you Surrender. Then, you permanently increase your
maximum Hit Points and maximum Mind Points by 10.
 Final Farewell: you Sacrifice yourself in place of your host, who immediately
recovers Hit Points equal to their Crisis score and no longer needs to Surrender or
Sacrifice themselves.

Zero Powers are an optional rule designed for stories in which Player Characters
unleash incredible strength when cornered. While they fit High Fantasy campaigns
especially well, they can be used in any game.
This rule will make the protagonists of your story downright excessive. As with any
optional rule, make sure to discuss its use with the entire group.
On average, a group using Zero Powers is expected to defeat most foes without too
much trouble, aside for those requiring specific strategies or intricate tactics.
CREATING A ZERO POWER
Each character who has access to this rule must create their own personal power,
choosing a trigger and an effect from the lists in the coming pages.
The same group must never include two or more PCs whose powers have the same
zero trigger, nor two or more PCs whose powers have the same zero effect.
USING ZERO POWERS
If your character has a Zero Power, they get a Zero Clock. This Clock has 6 sections and
can be “charged” during conflict scenes in the following ways:
 Fill 1 section each time you spend 1 Fabula Point to invoke a Trait or Bond (apply
this separately for each Fabula Point spent).
 Fill 1 section each time you lose Hit Points, unless that loss was self-inflicted (such
as with the Vismagus Skill from the Spiritist Class).
 Fill a variable number of sections when your chosen zero trigger activates.
On your turn during a conflict scene, if your Zero Clock is full, you may perform the
Skill action to unleash your zero effect. You may only do so once per turn.
 Unleashing the zero effect erases all sections of the Zero Clock.
 All sections of the Zero Clock are automatically erased at the end of each scene.
 Sections of the Zero Clock may not be filled nor erased in any way except as indicated
above, or through the Zero Chance effect (see page 126).

Mind Points, not those that increase recovery caused by a different effect).
Defiance 1 per trigger
This trigger activates at the start of your turn during a conflict, provided one or more
Villains and/or champion-Rank enemies are present on the scene.
Love 1 per trigger
Special rule: when you choose this trigger for your Zero Power, tie it to another Player
Character you have fallen in love with (the feeling doesn’t have to be reciprocal, but
make sure everyone in the group is comfortable with this dynamic).
This trigger activates when the character you love loses Hit Points (unless that HP
loss was self-inflicted) and/or Surrenders, provided you are able to see them.
If the character you love Sacrifices themselves and you witness their Sacrifice,
immediately fill your Zero Clock; at the end of the scene, choose a different trigger
for your Zero Power.
Revenge 3 per trigger
This trigger activates when you enter Crisis for the first time during a scene
Sequence 2 per trigger

enemies present on the scene are suffering from a total of two or more different
status effects (such as one dazed and weak enemy, or one slow enemy and another

Zero Blitz
You immediately perform a free attack with each weapon you have equipped. If you only
have one weapon equipped, the attack deals 20 extra damage; or, if you have more than
one weapon equipped, you gain a +5 bonus to the Accuracy Check for each attack.
Zero Chance
Choose odd or even, then roll 3d6 and see how many dice match your prediction.
Then, apply the corresponding effect or the effect immediately above it, your choice.
 No dice: Fill 3 sections of your Zero Clock, and fill 1 section of the Zero Clock of every
other Player Character you can see. Then, perform an additional action.
 One die: You perform a free attack with one weapon you have equipped. This attack
deals extra damage equal to the total rolled on the 3d6.
 Two dice: You deal damage equal to【 30 + half your level + the total rolled on the
3d6】 to one creature you can see. This damage has no type (ignore Affinities).
 Three dice: You and every ally you can see recover from all status effects and recover
an amount of HP and MP equal to【 your Crisis score + the total rolled on the 3d6】.
Finally, if all three dice show the same number, you may perform an additional action
during this turn (this is in addition to the action granted by “no dice”).
Zero Cost
Until the end of the scene, you treat all Inventory Point costs as being halved. You may
also immediately perform the Inventory action for free.
Zero Elements
Special rule: when you select this effect for your Zero Power, choose two damage
types among air, bolt, dark, earth, fire, ice, light, and poison.
You gain the following benefits: all damage you deal becomes of a type of your choice
among the two you selected when you created this Zero Power, its type cannot change,
and it ignores Absorption, Immunity and Resistance. Additionally, you deal 5 extra
damage (be it with attacks, spells, items, Arcana, or any other method).
These benefits last until the end of the scene, until you unleash this power again, or
until you end its effects (you may do so whenever you want).
You may also perform an additional action during this turn.

Zero Magic
You immediately perform the Spell action for free, casting a spell of your choice
among those you know; the spell’s total Mind Point cost is treated as being 0 (this
includes any cost increases due to Skills and effects). The spell deals 10 extra damage

Zero Objective
Choose one option: fill 3 sections of a Clock tied to the current scene; or erase 3
sections of a Clock tied to the current scene.
Zero Remedy
You and any number of allies you can see recover from all status effects and recover
an amount of Hit Points equal to【 40 + half your level】.

ZERO POWER VARIATIONS
Usually, each Player Character has their unique Zero Power from the start. However,
trying some variations of this rule can also be interesting.
d AWAKENED POWER
This variation of Zero Powers is ideal for epic stories where a hero can manifest an
unexpected new power when they are on the brink of disaster, or when something
changes their way of seeing the world.
If you choose this option, you choose the effect of your Zero Power during character
creation but not its trigger. You don’t have access to the power until you awaken it in
one of these ways:
 When your character reaches 0 HP during a conflict, you can
choose to awaken their power instead of Surrendering
or making a Sacrifice.
 When your character faces a terrible truth, an event
or memory causing great happiness or pain, or gains
access to a source of power crucial to the story – like
an artifact – you can choose to awaken their power.
When a character awakens their power, they immediately
recover Hit Points equal to their Crisis score, and gain access
to their Zero Power. They must also select a zero trigger
coherent with the event that helped unleash their hidden
potential. If the awakening happens during a conflict,
the Zero Clock fills immediately.
A Player Character can use this rule only once per
campaign. The Player chooses when the awakening
happens – just make sure the moment is fitting!

d COMBINED POWERS
This option links Zero Powers to the ties between group members instead of having
them connected to a lone character.
If you choose this option, apply the following rules:
 Each Player Character gains a zero trigger as per the normal rules, and a Zero Clock
with 4 sections instead of 6.
 Each Player Character gains one zero effect for each other Player Character – decide
together what they are. Each possible pair of PCs shares one zero effect.
 You can unleash the zero effect only when both Player’s Clocks are full. Only one
character needs to perform the Skill action, which empties both Clocks.
Example: your group has four Player Characters, and therefore four individual zero
triggers and six total zero effects. The gunslinger and samurai share the Zero Scourge
effect, which they nickname “Bullet Slicer”. Once both their Zero Clocks are full, either of
them can perform the Skill action to unleash the Bullet Slicer during their turn.
The Zero Power’s effects resolve only once, as if the character had unleashed a
standard Zero Power.
You should only use this complex option if there are four or fewer Player Characters.
Remember to refresh the possible combinations each time the group changes – that’s
why it’s alright for there to be more than one version of the same zero effect per
group. However, the triggers should all be different, if possible.
If you combine this option with the Awakened Powers described above, just invert
things slightly: you choose your triggers during character creation and decide the
effect of each combination when one of the Players awakens the power. Also, each
Player Character has access to one awakening for each PC in the campaign with
whom they can create a combined power.
“Today, we face you together –
it won’t be like the last time!”

CHANTER SKILLS
MAGICHANT (ç10)
On your turn during a conflict scene, you may use an action and spend a variable
amount of MP to weave voice and music into a magical effect known as a verse.
You may only sing one verse per turn, even if you have access to multiple actions; the
full rules for verses can be found starting on the next page.
When you first acquire this Skill, you learn all three volumes, plus one key and one
tone (see next page). Whenever you acquire this Skill again, you may learn one key or
one tone (your choice).
RESONANCE (ç3)
After you affect one or more enemies with a verse, if you have an arcane weapon
equipped, you may choose one option: until the start of your next turn, your allies deal
【SL】 extra damage to those enemies; or until the start of your next turn, you recover
【SL】 Mind Points every time one of those enemies suffers damage (if the same
source deals damage to two or more of those enemies at the same time, you recover
【SL】 MP for each damaged enemy).
SIREN’S SONG
You gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Ritualism discipline; additionally, you
may use Ritualism to create hearing-based illusions.
SOUND BARRIER (ç5)
After you sing a verse with medium or high volume, all physical damage you suffer
until the start of your next turn is reduced by【 SL】 (applied before Affinities).
VIBRATO
After you sing a verse with low or medium volume, you may perform a free attack with
a weapon you have equipped; treat your High Roll (HR) as 0 when calculating damage
dealt by this attack.

SINGING A VERSE
When you sing a verse, you combine a volume, a key and a tone you learned. These
three aspects determine the verse’s MP cost, targets and effect.
 The volume determines the sound intensity of your verse (and the creatures you can
reach with it).
 Each tone determines the general effects of your verse.
 Each key has an associated damage type, status effect, Attribute and recovery. These
modify the effects determined by the tone of your verse.
Example: you might combine a low volume with the key of Flame and a haunting
tone to inflict shaken on a single creature for 10 Mind Points, or you could combine
a medium volume with the key of Iron and an energetic tone to allow your allies to
make additional progress on Clocks when using Willpower.
VOLUME MP TARGETS
Low 10 Yourself or another creature you can see who can hear you.
Medium 20 Every ally who can hear you.
High 30 Every enemy who can hear you.

If this tone causes MP recovery, it has no effect on the character who sings it.
Energetic
Until the start of your next turn, when a target succeeds on a Check that includes【 key

or erase an additional section of that Clock.
Frantic
Each target suffers【 key type】 damage equal to twice your current Willpower die
size. This tone deals 10 extra damage if you are level 20 or higher, or 20 extra damage
if you are level 40 or higher.
Haunting
Each target suffers 【key status effect】. Each target also loses Resistance to 【key
type】 damage (if they have it) until the start of your next turn.
Lively
Each target treats thei【r key Attribute】 as being one die size higher (up to a maximum

Menacing
The first time each target suffers damage before the start of your next turn, that damage

Symbols follow a set of special rules.
 A creature may only bear one symbol at a time — if they receive a new symbol,
regardless of source, any previous symbol is destroyed.
 Symbols and their effects have unlimited durations until destroyed.
 If a Symbolist dies, each symbol they created is immediately and automatically
destroyed.
 If a creature bearing a symbol dies, that symbol is also destroyed.
However, if the creature is a NPC that simply changes its form and statistics when reduced
to 0 Hit Points, that does not remove the symbol: in short, the symbol is “narratively”
tied to that specific character, not to their current manifestation and parameters.
 A Villain may, during a Game Master scene, spend 1 Ultima Point to destroy any
number of symbols borne by themselves and by any of their allies that are present
during that scene.
This is the only possible way to remove a symbol against the will of the Symbolist
who created it, save for the use of an opportunity appropriate to the scene or an NPC
Skill specifically created by the GM (but this should be done no more than two or
three times per campaign).
 A Symbolist may destroy any number of their symbols at any time, no action required.
 If a symbol requires you to make a choice when it is created, that choice applies to all
copies of the symbol created with that action (but does not affect any copies of that
symbol created through previous actions).
For instance, if a Symbolist applies two symbols of weakness (fire) through the
Symbolism Skill, combining it with an attack with the multi (2) property, the creatures
who receive those symbols will suffer extra damage from fire. If shortly afterwards the
Symbolist applies a symbol of weakness (bolt) on a third creature, the two previous
creatures will still receive extra damage from fire, not bolt.
Remember that the maximum number of symbols you may have active at the same
time is based on your Skill Level in Symbolism.

Symbol of Creation
When the creature bearing this symbol needs to spend Inventory Points during a

Symbol of Despair
When the creature bearing this symbol recovers Hit Points and/or Mind Points during
conflicts, instead they only recover half the normal amount of Hit Points and/or Mind

Symbol of Destiny
After the creature bearing this symbol makes a Check, if you are able to see them, you

5 Hit Points and 5 Mind Points (before performing that action). Both amounts increse
to 10 if you are level 20 or higher, or to 20 if you are level 40 or higher.
Symbol of Growth
Spells with a target of “Up to three creatures” cast by the creature bearing this symbol
have a target of “Up to four creatures” instead. The creature still needs to spend
additional Mind Points for a fourth target.
Symbol of Metamorphosis
When you create this symbol, choose a Species: beast, construct, demon, elemental,

When you hit one or more creatures with an attack using a weapon that belongs to the
arcane Category, the attack deals 5 extra damage and you may choose one of those

chosen creature, its Magic Check will trigger a critical success if both dice show the
same number (and the Check is not a fumble).

BIMAGUS
Requirements: you must have mastered two or more Classes among Elementalist,
Entropist, and Spiritist, and your character must be level 30 or higher.
Once per turn during a conflict, if you have an arcane weapon equipped, you may use
an action and spend 20 to 50 Mind Points to perform the Spell action for free twice,
casting two spells without needing to pay their MP costs. If you do, the two spells must

creatures that cannot normally be targeted by melee attacks.
BULLET BREAK

CEASELESS BATTLEFIELD
Requirements: you must have mastered the Commander Class.
The MP costs for your Bishop’s Edict, Charging Cavalry and King’s Castle are halved.

CLEAN SLATE
Requirements: you must have mastered the Symbolist Class.
You may use an action and spend up to 30 Mind Points to choose one creature you
can see for every 5 MP spent this way. Each creature chosen this way recovers from all
status effects and is no longer affected by any spells with a duration of “Scene” that
were affecting them.
DOUBLE ARROW
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Commander and
Sharpshooter.
When you perform the Attack action with a ranged weapon that belongs to the bow
Category, if you have no other weapon equipped, you may perform two separate
attacks instead of one (against the same target or against different targets). If you do,
both attacks follow the rules for two-weapon fighting: each attack loses the multi
property and cannot gain it, and you treat the High Roll of each Accuracy Check as
being equal to 0 when determining damage.
Note that this Heroic Skill does not stack with a custom weapon’s quick customization
(using Twin Arrows with a quick bow doesn’t allow more than two attacks, in short).
FAST RITUALS
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Chimerist,
Elementalist, Entropist, and Spiritist.
When you initiate a Ritual during a conflict scene, its Ritual Clock is created with two
fewer sections than normal, to a minimum of four sections.
FLEETING MOMENT
Requirements: you must have mastered the Weaponmaster Class, and must have
acquired the Counterattack Skill.
When you perform a Counterattack using a melee weapon that belongs to the sword
Category, you may add your High Roll to the damage dealt by the attack (you do not
have to treat it as being 0).
156
W
GRAND SUMMONING
Requirements: you must have mastered the Arcanist Class, and your character must
be level 30 or higher.
When you summon an Arcanum, you may decide to spend 1 Fabula Point and spend
half of your current Hit Points (rounded down) to shape your lifeforce into a full
manifestation of their power. If you do, the Arcanum manifests as a soldier-rank
creature of the demon Species under your control (they count as an ally and have their
own independent turn during conflicts – if you use this Skill during a conflict scene,
the Arcanum joins the scene at the end of the current round). You also do not gain any
of the merge benefits you would normally enjoy when summoning that Arcanum.The
summoned creature has the following profile:
 Level is equal to your level (thus gaining the bonuses to Checks and damage
listed under steps 8 on page 303 of the Core Rulebook).
 A d10 in one Attribute of your choice, and a d8 in all other Attributes.
 Maximum Hit Points equal to【 twice the creature’s base Might die size, plus
half of your maximum Hit Points】. The creature has no Mind Points.
 Resistance to two damage types of your choice.
 The creature receives all the merge benefits the Arcanum would normally grant
you when summoned (damage Affinities, immunity to status effects, increased
Attribute sizes, etc.). If a merge benefit would cause the Arcanum to be dismissed,
this will cause the summoned creature to vanish unless you spend 20 Mind Points.
 A melee basic attack whose Accuracy Check relies on two different Attributes of
your choice and deals【 HR + 8】 physical damage. Choose two different options:
the attack is a ranged attack; or it deals 4 extra damage; or it deals damage of
a type other than physical; or the Accuracy Check relies on a single Attribute.
 The creature may perform the Skill action to produce one of the dismiss effects
normally granted by that Arcanum, but doing so will cause the summoned
creature to vanish unless you spend 20 Mind Points.
The following rules apply when you Grand Summon an Arcanum:
 The creature is always summoned at full Hit Points, with no status effects.
 The creature vanishes if it reaches 0 Hit Points, if you die, lose consciousness or
leave the scene, or if you summon or Grand Summon an Arcanum again. The
creature also vanishes when a scene ends, or if you simply command them to do
so (this will not trigger the corresponding Arcanum’s dismiss effect).
 Take note of all choices made for Attributes and basic attack during the first time
Summon a given Arcanum: these choices will remain unchanged whenever you
Grand Summon that same Arcanum again in the future.

HOPLITE
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Commander and
Guardian.
As long as you have a weapon equipped in your main hand slot and a shield equipped
in your off-hand slot, your attacks with that weapon deal 5 extra damage and you gain
a +1 bonus to Defense.
This Skill cannot be combined with custom weapons with the defence boost
customization (page 107), nor with the Dual Shieldbearer Skill (page 197 of the Core
Rulebook).
IRON FOREST
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Commander and
Weaponmaster.
After you hit one or more creatures with a melee attack using a weapon that belongs
to the spear Category, if you have no other weapon equipped, you may spend 20 Mind
Points and choose one of those creatures. If you do so, the attack deals half the normal
amount of damage to each of its targets, and you choose one type of action among the
following: Attack, Guard, Objective, Spell, or Skill. From now on, the chosen creature
must spend 10 Mind Points whenever they wish to perform that type of action. If they
can’t, they must perform a different type of action. This effect lasts until the start of
your next turn, or until you use this Skill again.
MAGIC GUARD
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Chimerist,
Elementalist, Entropist, and Spiritist.
When you perform the Guard action, if you choose not to provide cover to another
creature, you gain the following benefit until the start of your next turn: when a
creature you can see casts a spell, after that creature pays for the spell’s MP cost, you
may spend an amount of Mind Points equal to【 10 + the spell’s total MP cost】 in
order to completely stop the casting of the spell and negate its effects (the spell isn’t
cast, but the creature is still considered to have spent their action).
Argus lancers developed their own fighting style
inspired by the region’s intricate forests.

PASO DOBLE
Requirements: you must have mastered the Dancer Class, and must have acquired the
Follow My Lead Skill.
While you are in Crisis, you ignore the MP cost for your Follow My Lead Skill.
POWER CHORD
Requirements: you must have mastered the Chanter Class.
When you sing a verse with medium or high volume, you may may double the verse’s
cost in Mind Points, or spend 1 Fabula Point. If you do, you and every ally that is able
to hear you gain the following benefit until the start of your next turn: your Accuracy
Checks trigger a critical success when both dice show the same number (as long as the
Check is not a fumble).
PULVERIZING STRIKE
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Darkblade, Fury,
and Weaponmaster.
After you hit a creature with Breach, if you attacked with a melee weapon that belongs
to the heavy Category, you may have the attack deal damage equal to your High Roll
(HR) instead of dealing no damage. Any source of extra damage, including the extra
damage from the third option of the Breach Skill itself, still applies — ignore the
damage dealt by the weapon.
RISING TIDE
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Fury and
Weaponmaster.
When you perform a melee attack using a weapon that belongs to the brawling Category,
if you have no martial armor and no shields equipped, you gain 1 Bravery Point.
Your melee attacks using weapons that belong to the brawling Category deal extra
damage equal to your current Bravery Points.
At the end of each scene, or if you have 5 or more Bravery Points at the end of your
turn, you must spend all your accumulated Bravery Points and recover 10 Hit Points
and Mind Points.

CHAPTER
RITUAL SEALS
Requirements: you must have mastered the Symbolist Class.
When you perform a Ritual outside a conflict scene, if that Ritual has a total cost equal
to or lower than 60 Mind Points, you may stop the process immediately before the
Magic Check and store the Ritual’s effect inside a Ritual seal placed on a surface you
can touch. If you do, name a condition — this can be anything from “when I enter Crisis”
to “as soon as I snap my fingers”. When that condition is met, the seal vanishes and the
Ritual is unleashed at the seal’s location: you perform the Magic Check and resolve the
effects as normal (even if you are unconscious or not present on the scene).
You may only have one Ritual seal active at the same time — if you die or create a new
Ritual seal, the one you previously created will vanish.
SHOWSTOPPER
Requirements: you must have mastered the Dancer Class.
At the start of your turn during a conflict, if you have no martial armor equipped, you
may spend 1 Fabula Point to immediately perform up to three different dances among
those you know, in the order you prefer and without paying their MP cost. If you do, you
cannot perform dances in any way until the end of your next turn..
SPIDER’S WEB
Requirements: you must have mastered the Weaponmaster Class.
When you perform the Attack action with a melee weapon that belongs to the flail
Category, if you have no other weapon equipped, you may perform two separate
attacks instead of one (against the same target or against different targets). If you do,
both attacks follow the rules for two-weapon fighting: each attack loses the multi
property and cannot gain it, and you treat the High Roll of each Accuracy Check as
being equal to 0 when determining damage.
Note that this Heroic Skill does not stack with a custom weapon’s quick customization
(using Spider’s Web with a quick flail doesn’t allow more than two attacks, in short).

W
SWIRLING SWARM
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Dancer, Fury, and
Sharpshooter.
When you perform a ranged attack using a weapon that belongs to the thrown Category,
if you have no martial armor and no shields equipped, you gain 1 Momentum Point.
You may never have more than 5 Momentum Points.
Your ranged attacks using weapons that belong to the thrown Category deal extra
damage equal to your current Momentum Points.
When a creature hits you with an attack targeting your Defense, you must spend all
your accumulated Momentum Points and increase your Defense score by an equal
amount against that attack (this may turn the hit into a miss).
You also lose all Momentum Points at the end of each scene.
TABULA RASA
Requirements: you must have mastered the Commander Class.
After you use Bishop’s Edict or King’s Castle Skills, if you are in Crisis, you may have every
enemy creature present on the scene lose 10 Hit Points. This amount increases to 20 Hit
Points if you are level 20 or higher, or 30 Hit Points if you are level 40 or higher.

CHAPTER
THEME SONG
Requirements: you must have mastered the Chanter Class.
When you acquire this Skill, you obtain a theme song – give it a name and assign it a
key from the ones you have learned (you can also choose a real-world song for this).
Once per conflict scene after you sing a verse in your theme song’s key, you may start
your theme song — if it’s a real song, it’s a great idea to play it in the background!
While singing your theme song, you gain the following benefits:
 You gain Resistance to【 theme song’s key type】 damage.
 When you deal【 theme song’s key type】 damage, you deal 5 extra damage
and the type of that damage cannot be changed.
 The MP cost for singing verses in the same key as your theme song is halved.
This benefit applies to you and to any of your allies who are able to sing
verses.
The theme song lasts until the end of the scene or until you leave the scene, die, or
fall unconscious. The theme song also ends as soon as you sing a verse in a key other
than the theme song’s, if your turn ends and you have not sung any verse, or if another
character starts their theme song.
TRIPLE SLASH
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes among Dancer and
Weaponmaster.
As long as you have a one-handed melee weapon that belongs to the dagger or sword
Categories equipped in each of your normal hand slots, you may treat your armor
slot as if it were a second off-hand slot. You may only use this special slot to equip a
onehanded melee weapon that belongs to the dagger or sword Categories — note that
the Monkey Grip Skill does not turn two-handed weapons into one-handed weapons,
and thus cannot be used in combination with Triple Slash.
When you perform the Attack action while you have three daggers and/or swords
equipped, you may attack once with each weapon. This follows the normal rules for
two-weapon fighting: each of the three attacks loses the multi property and cannot
gain it, and you treat the High Roll (HR) of each Accuracy Check as being equal to 0
when determining damage.

ANTAGONISTS
This book’s fourth and final chapter delves into the creation of high fantasy enemy
NPCs – especially Villains. Game Masters can combine it with similar advice from the
Core Rulebook (mostly from page 292 onwards) to plan riveting clashes for all game
levels. As usual, you can use the material as is or adapt it to your liking by following
the advice below.
HIGH FANTASY VILLAINS
An introductory section with tips and advice for creating and playing pivotal
antagonists in the high fantasy style.
VILLAIN EXAMPLES
Five different enemy NPCs – one each for levels 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 – that make
ideal high fantasy Villains. For each, you’ll find this information:
 History. The Villain’s base concept and possible backstory.
 Profile. The Villain’s statistics, as described on page 320 of the Core Rulebook.
 Tactics. The Villain’s preferred combat tactics.
 Extra content. One or more additional ideas, including tips for modifying the Villain’s
profile, possible supporting enemies, and even additional phases (Core Rulebook,
page 301) you can use during conflicts.
These Villains were designed to spark the Game Master’s imagination and assume a
group of 4 well-rounded PCs. Remember that some of their abilities might not conform
to the standard cost for NPC Skills (Core Rulebook, page 303) and that you’ll likely
need to tweak these Villains before including them in your campaigns. To balance
things out, consider your Player Characters’ capacities and then modify any opposing
Affinities, immunities to status effects, damage types, or other parameters that could
be frustrating to deal with or unsuitable for your group’s campaign.
164
W
HIGH FANTASY VILLAINS
When you create a high fantasy antagonist, the information on page 254 of the Core
Rulebook is an excellent starting point, but there are a few extra things to remember,
just as there are for Player Characters.
BASIC PRINCIPLES
Just like protagonists, high fantasy Villains are deeply connected to a specific theme
that informs their every move.
 Extreme worldviews. These antagonists make no compromises, driven as they are
by apparently unshakable beliefs that justify their actions. The PCs will likely need to
defeat them before they can have a conversation – or perhaps the antagonists might
launch into a monologue about their ambitions after cornering the heroes.
 Custom built. This concept from the Core Rulebook is crucial: high fantasy Villains
should be bound tightly to the Player Characters’ goals, hopes, and fears.
 Emotional stories. High fantasy Villains should cause the protagonists to feel strong
emotions, including frustration, rage, fear, and even admiration and pity – anything
goes, as long as it’s not indifference. The most devious Villains may even rely on the
PCs’ reactions to manipulate them at will, using them as pawns – this can be a great
twist, but best to rely on it only once or twice per campaign.
It might seem challenging to properly portray a complex Villain. Fear not – the trick is
making the most of these two techniques:
 Game Master scenes. These scenes let you show the Villains interacting with their
underlings, planning moves, and maybe confessing their ambitions, doubts, and pains
to someone they trust. It’s the best way to show a Villain’s many facets or to reinforce
the feeling that their powers make them truly unstoppable unless the protagonists
actively thwart their efforts.
 Conflicts. When the Villain is on the scene, their actions and abilities should say
something about who they are: a great warrior’s battle lust, the careful scheming of
a prince, or a sorcerer’s devastating magic are just some examples of details that can
enrich the story, making Villains feel like than mere powered-up NPCs. Also, Villains
should speak freely and with cutting honesty during conflicts, showing the Players
their true colors.

CHAPTER
(ALMOST) RELATABLE MOTIVATIONS
High fantasy antagonists are capable of truly horrific actions, but their motivations
should be almost understandable – though never justified! In some memorable
cases, these opponents can even become tragic antiheroes or unexpected allies
in the battle against the “final foe”, the true Villain who was hidden in the shadows
until then.
Example: an empress invading neighboring realms in a desperate attempt to gather
resources to fend off a terrible demon; a sorcerer ready to commit any vileness to go
back in time and stop an event that – they think – doomed the world.
If you want to highlight your most complex antagonists, ensure that not all Villains
are misunderstood individuals waiting for redemption. Sometimes they are just
cruel people who use their misfortunes as justifications, and manipulate others out
of curiosity or caprice. After all, these are also strong motivations that could dovetail
nicely with your Player Characters’ Themes.
A FACE FROM THE PAST
Tying a Villain to a Player Character’s past can provide an exciting twist and change
the group’s expectations.
Typical examples are the return of a mentor figure who has now become a fearsome
adversary or the discovery that an antagonist is really a protagonist’s relative, friend,
or love interest.
In these cases, it’s a good idea to ask the Player whose character is involved in the
twist to add details about their past relations with the antagonist, perhaps even
playing out the revelation as a flashback scene.
These scenes tend to be very intense and strongly affect the protagonists’ psychology
– the Game Master should encourage Players to tweak and modify the “grand reveal”
so it doesn’t derail or sabotage their character’s path of personal growth.
In other words, plot twists work best when they reinforce a character’s narrative arc
instead of overturning it.
166
W
UNMISTAKABLE LOOKS
Style is a vital feature of all high fantasy Villains, including how they dress, their
equipment, the magic they wield, their signature colors, and so on.
These features often extend to a Villain’s underlings and henchmen – truly selfreferential
behavior!
 A beast encircled by flower-like sigils, similar to those that appear when the forest
witch casts her spells.
 War golems with large imperial crests on their chests.
 Airships painted a vivid red, to match their admiral’s hair.
High fantasy antagonists tend to be flamboyant, leaving many traces of their passing.
Conversely, a Villain who sticks to the shadows or has a sidekick with a very different
style from their own provides an interesting exception that enriches the story and says
something about them.
WHO’S AFRAID OF THE LIGHT?
Interestingly, high fantasy stories often move beyond the easy juxtaposition of “good”
light and “evil” darkness. Truth is, both of these powers can be used for terrible deeds,
and using one or the other is not an obvious sign of one’s morals.
For example, Cerine (page 178) is a powerful wielder of the dark arts who is moved
by desperation, and is willing to engage in discussion if the Player Characters show
kindness. On the other hand, Maximilian (page 184) appears as an honorable
adversary but hides his insecurity and aggressiveness.
This perspective makes characters more layered and complex, but it may not be what
your group wants from Fabula Ultima. Sometimes it’s perfectly fine to decide that
light and darkness have moral implications – in these cases, a Player Character using
abilities that deal dark damage will become a powerful narrative statement to explore.

CHAPTER
BATTLING THE DIVINE
Following from the previous point, entities wielding divine powers aren’t necessarily
guardians and protectors of humanity in high fantasy tales. Quite the opposite: the
supreme Villain at the end of a campaign often has divine features.
The Villain’s divine powers could be an innate ability or something they developed
over the course of the campaign, potentially through an escalation (Core Rulebook,
page 102).
When dealing with these entities, keep three things in mind:
 Power source. Where do the entities’ incredible powers come from? Are they born of
obsessions, awful desires, or from the belief of an entire people?
The Gods and Demons section (page 71) delves deeper into these questions.
 Connections. What is the connection between the entity and the Player Characters? Is
it the ancient goddess who protects their homeland? Perhaps a millennia-old threat
that the heroes mistakenly awoke?
In any case, foreshadow the existence of this adversary a few times during the
campaign using clues and omens, and make sure that its motivations are at least
partially connected to the protagonists’ actions.
 Mythic and religious references. The myths and beliefs of the real world have
inspired some of the most powerful JRPG antagonists – if you want to follow suit, be
mindful of how you represent these entities.
When a campaign includes a divine antagonist, the “true happy ending” usually only
happens once the world’s people resume their normal life, finally free to peacefully
coexist without supernatural influences. The entity might even realize that wanting to
dominate the world was a mistake, and decide to accompany the people toward a new
future – or sacrifice itself to ensure they have one.

EILEEN, PIRATE QUEEN
W
Any sailor worth their salt knows that there are three forces of nature to be wary of
when sailing upon the Entegard Sea: storms, sea monsters, and Eileen. An infamous
pirate with an unquenchable thirst for gold, her origins are shrouded in mystery. Some
say she was born a noble, but fell into piracy out of choice or necessity. Some say she
is the princess of a fallen kingdom. Some say people should shut up and keep rowing,
or she’ll catch up to them.
Whatever her story, it’s hard to deny Eileen’s natural gift for battle, as well as her
powerful charisma – her sailors are fiercely loyal, and will follow her to hell and back.
The pirate queen shares no such feelings: her first priority is her own safety, with profit
being a close second. The needs of her allies are a very distant third, and anything else
is too low to warrant a number.
Eileen might be swayed into serving a just cause if she can turn a profit. However,
anyone who enlists her aid should sleep with one eye open – preferably the one that
can see her deadly harpoon.

ANTAGONISTS
CHAPTER
EILEEN’S TACTICS
During combat, Eileen uses flexible tactics and coordinates her crew. Her transforming
weapon starts in harpoon form.
 On her first turn every round, Eileen uses Strike Now! to make one of her allies
attack, unless she is alone or has no Mind Points, in which case she attacks using her
weapon’s current form instead.
 On her second turn, Eileen strikes with her weapon. If her weapon is in harpoon
form and there are flying opponents, she uses Soaring Strike – provided she has the
necessary Mind Points – to ground them.
 On her third turn, Eileen uses Soaring Strike if her weapon is in harpoon form and
she has enough MP, otherwise she simply attacks with her weapon’s current form.
After this routine, Eileen changes her weapon form – don’t forget the harpoon form
gives her +2 Defense.
Eileen always uses the opportunities produced by her Checks to let a Salamander
or Cryomander attack if they are present. If she rolls a double on her Accuracy Check,
she always applies her unique ability, Lady of Fortune, to transform it into a critical
success, unleashing her loyal lizards against the unlucky foe.
Eileen always saves 1 Ultima Point for Escaping. If cornered, she will ask the PCs to let
her go in exchange for treasure or information, but if this option fails, she spends her
last Ultima Point to escape amid a barrage of cannon fire.
During non-combat conflicts, Eileen relies on her Charismatic Presence as much as
possible, which is why she is rarely seen without her crew. However, if things aren’t
going her way, she has no qualms about relying on brute force instead – that’s what
she excels at, after all!

Eileen may be aided by salamanders, cryomanders, and pirates.
 Salamanders use Burning Breath during their turn, or Burning Bite if they are out of
Mind Points. When using Burning Bite, they prefer to target PCs without status effects
or with high HP.
 Cryomanders use Freezing Breath during their turn if they have enough Mind Points.
Otherwise, they use Freezing Bite or Guard to protect Eileen if she is in Crisis. When
attacking with Freezing Bite, they prefer to target PCs suffering from slow.
 Pirates use a Saber in the rounds when Eileen uses her Revolver, and the Pistol
when Eileen uses the Harpoon. If Eileen is in Crisis, the pirates use Hang On, Boss!
to heal her. During non-combat conflicts, they use Braggard to strengthen Eileen and
weaken her foes.
If Eileen falls, her allies cover her escape – if she uses an Ultima Point – or otherwise
just stop fighting.

ONE WORLD, MANY PIRATES
Eileen and her crew were designed to fit a maritime context but you can also use their
statistics for sky or sand pirates. In these cases, consider the following:
 How do they move. If their setting is not oceanic, what do they ride? Airships? Trained,
floating titans? Colossal sandworms?
 Change the crew’s looks. You can quickly turn bandanas, sabers, and pistols into
aviator goggles, wrenches, and grappling hooks.
 Modify the creatures that accompany them. Instead of salamanders and cryomanders,
the crew might be aided by winged or subterranean creatures. In most cases, all you
need to do is change the creatures’ Affinities and the type of damage they deal.

THE QUARTERMASTER
If Eileen plays a significant role in the campaign, the group will likely face her crew

ship’s quartermaster.
Here are some tips on how to spice up the encounter:
 Use the bonus Skill granted by the elite rank to add multi (2) to the Saber attack. The
saber itself could be replaced with a rare weapon.
 Change the quartermaster’s Affinities so they’re not the same as the rest of the crew’s.
 Other pirates can use Hang On, Boss! on the quartermaster; the quartermaster
cannot use this ability but can inflict a status effect with the Pistol shot – dazed or
shaken are excellent choices.

FLAME DRAGON
W
Historically, heroes and dragons have had complicated relationships – there are as
many dragon slayers as there are dragon riders. Be it a friend or foe, an encounter with
a dragon often marks a milestone in any hero’s tale.
Typical encounters with dragons see the heroes keeping their distance, preparing for
the moment when they’re discovered. Dragons are ancient creatures deeply tied to
magic, so each has their own personality and desires. Depending on their demeanor,
they may be open to conversation, giving the characters information and even aid,
in exchange for something they think valuable: riches, knowledge, an offering or
sacrifice, or sometimes a simple witticism.
Lastly, one should never trespass on a dragon’s lair uninvited – dragons are known
to be fiercely territorial, and do not suffer intruders lightly. Conversely, receiving an
invitation from a dragon is a sign of deep trust... or it could be a deadly trap.

CHAPTER
FLAME DRAGON’S TACTICS
This dragon is a formidable foe and is used to battling multiple several opponents at
once, as is clear from their tactics.
 On their first turn in the first round, the flame dragon uses Thundering Roar to inflict
the shaken status effect on as many foes as possible. On their first turn of other rounds,
they use Gift of Flame to enchant an enemy weapon, making it useless. The dragon
first targets weapons dealing ice damage. If there are none, they pick one randomly.
If they lack Mind Points, the dragon uses this turn to protect themselves with the
Guard action.
 On their second turn, the flame dragon attacks with Draconic Breath if they are
airborne and have enough Mind Points. If not, they use Rending Claws.
 On their third turn, the flame dragon attacks with Piercing Fangs.
 On their fourth turn, the flame dragon attacks with Draconic Breath if they have
sufficient Mind Points, otherwise they use Rending Claws.
The flame dragon should always pick their targets randomly: not because they’re
incapable of strategy, but to give the feeling of facing a massive force of nature.
Also, remember that, despite being melee attacks, Rending Claws and Piercing Fangs
do not expose the flame dragon to Counterattacks (Core Rulebook, page 219) if the
flame dragon is flying – unless the attacked character is also flying or armed with
melee weapons that can target flying creatures.
If the flame dragon is fighting outside their lair, they spend an Ultima Point to safely
leave the scene as soon as they fall to 90 HP or less. If fought inside their lair, however,
they defend it until their very last breath.
In non-combat conflicts, the flame dragon relies on their bulk and ability to fly to
dominate the scene. In social situations, their Reverential Fear and deep knowledge
make them nearly impossible to debate with: cowed or humbled, most people will
simply do as the dragon command, without much resistance. If facing more valiant,
the flame dragon does not hesitate to intimidate them with their Thunderous Roar.

OTHER ACTIONS
S Gift of Flame w The flame dragon may use one action and spend 10 Mind Points to choose a
weapon equipped by a creature they can see: all damage dealt by that weapon becomes fire.
This effect lasts until the end of the scene, or until the flame dragon uses Gift of Flame again.
SPECIAL RULES
Draconic Vitality w When the flame dragon enters Crisis for the first time in a scene, they
recover 20 Hit Points, recover from all status effects, lose the Hardened Scales special rule, and
increase their Might die size by one until the end of the scene.
Flying w See the Core Rulebook, page 307.
Fuel to the Fire w When the dragon loses 30 or more Hit Points from a single source, their next
use of Draconic Breath will deal 5 extra damage. This effect stacks – every time a source causes
the dragon to lose 30 or more HP, the damage of the next Draconic Breath will increase by
5 – until they finally unleash Draconic Breath.
Hardened Scales w As long as they are airborne, the flame dragon has Resistance to all damage
types except ice.
Rain of Fire w As long as the flame dragon is not in Crisis, the cost of Draconic Breath becomes
“10 x T MP”, and its target becomes “Up to two creatures”.
Reverential Fear w Shaken creatures suffer a -2 penalty to Accuracy Checks and Opposed
Checks performed against the flame dragon.

OTHER DRAGONS
If a flame dragon doesn’t fit the needs of the group, you can modify the creature’s
profile in several ways. Here are some examples:
 Ice dragon. Vulnerable to fire damage and Immune to
ice; swap all references to fire and ice in the fire dragon’s
profile. Fuel to the Fire could become Undying Winter, Gift
of Flame turns into Gift of Ice, and so on.
 Stone dragon. Vulnerable to air damage and Immune
to earth. You’ll need to rework several sections of
the profile to emphasize the connection to the
earth. This dragon might not be able to fly, but
they could Absorb earth damage instead. You may connect
Hardened Scales to not being in Crisis, instead of being
airborne.
 Storm dragon. Vulnerable to earth damage and Immune
to bolt. You’ll need to tweak several sections of the profile
to emphasize the connection to lightning. You could swap
Hardened Scales for Celestial Tyrant: the effect is
the same, but the storm dragon does not lose the
ability to fly when in Crisis.
 Divine dragon. Vulnerable to dark damage and
Immune to light. You’ll need to rework several sections of
the profile to emphasize the connection to light. Fuel to the
Fire could become Draconsecration: when the divine
dragon deals light damage to a creature, that
creature receives the Holywyrm’s Brand. When a
marked creature is struck again, the brand vanishes,
and the attacker recovers 10 Hit Points.

CERINE, MOURNFUL LADY
W
Long ago, in the small fiefdom of Tarranorn, lived a pair of sisters hailed as heroes.
Cecilia was the greatest swordmaster of the realm, while Cerine was a priestess
unrivaled in the use of sacred magic. Together, the two elevated Tarranorn to a great
power, carving their deeds into the annals of history. People near and far lauded them
as chosen by Fate, destined to usher in a new age of glory for the world.
Unfortunately, Fate is a fickle patron, and the sisters’ growing popularity brought the
King’s mistrust upon them. Betrayed by the one she had sworn to serve, Cecilia met an
ignominious end in a nameless mire, cursing her fate to the last breath. Racked with
grief, Cerine left her station in the kingdom, letting it collapse under the weight of its
own corruption.
Cerine has dedicated her life to bringing her sister back, turning her talents to the dark
arts and performing ghastly rites to become a lich. She still strives to breathe life back
into her beloved “Ceci”. In turn, Cecilia’s ghost stands by her sister – an unshakable
guardian, striking down all that oppose her “Ceri”.

CHAPTER
Major Villain (10 Ultima Points); Champion 3 (worth 3 soldiers)
CERINE’S TACTICS
Usually, Cerine does not disturb Cecilia’s rest unless necessary. Instead, several
spectral servants (page 182) accompany her during the first encounters with the PCs.
 During these first encounters, Cerine uses her first and third turn of each round to
cast Lux against as many targets as possible, changing its damage type to dark with
All Light Casts a Shadow to avoid possible Affinities. In her second turn, Cerine casts
Forced Tribute, Dispel, or Enrage if her opponents rely on spells.
 The spectral servants always use the Guard action to cover Cerine; then, they answer
melee attacks with their Rage Claw.
If the PCs corner Cerine in her hideout, she summons her sister Cecilia – all spectral
servants in the scene are consumed by the evocation and disappear.
 In these cases, Cerine moves to a support role: she uses her first turn of each odd
round to cast Acceleration on Cecilia and the first turn of each even round to cast
Dispel or Enrage. If she runs out of Mind Points, she simply attacks with Heart of the
Goddess instead.
On her second turn, Cerine casts Forced Tribute; on her third turn, she uses Soulshift
to help Cecilia recover as many MP as possible, or she spends 1 Ultima Point to
recover Mind Points instead.
If Cecilia is defeated and the PCs do not spare her, Cerine is overcome by grief and
begins attacking repeatedly with Lux; however, if the heroes show mercy, Cerine is
deeply touched (see A Light in Darkness, page 183).
 Cecilia always uses Undying Devotion to protect her sister. During her turns, she
always uses all available actions to strike with Martyr’s Slash, making sure to include
whoever last harmed her or her sister among the targets. If Cerine and Cecilia are
suffering from four or more status effects combined, Cecilia uses one of her actions
to cast Cleanse.
Cerine will rarely summon Cecilia outside her hideout and will spend 1 Ultima Point
to Escape the scene when defeated. When fighting with Cecilia by her side, Cerine will
not back down.

S Martyr’s Slash w Cecilia can use an action and spend 10 Mind Points to perform a free attack
with Resentment. If she does, the attack gains multi (2) and deals 5 extra damage.
SPECIAL RULES
Arcane Resurrection w Cecilia has no Hit Points. When an effect would cause her to lose or
recover HP, she loses or recovers Mind Points instead.
Undead w Cecilia is immune to poisoned and HP recovery may harm her (Core Rulebook, page
305). Additionally, Cecilia becomes Vulnerable to light damage again if she loses her armor.
Undying Devotion w Cecilia can protect Cerine if she is in danger, using the same rules as the
Protect Skill (Core Rulebook, page 197) except Cecilia can always use this ability and does
not need to wait until her next turn to recharge it. If Cerine is defeated or surrenders, Cecilia
surrenders as well.
HOW DO YOU CALCULATE THAT?
Due to her Arcane Resurrection special rule, Cecilia has no Hit Points: she must rely on
her Mind Points as a gauge measuring her “health” level. Her MP total isn’t the result of
a precise equation, but rather she has been assigned an amount that felt appropriate
to her level, making sure she can take a few hits – especially from effects that directly
reduce MP, such as the Bone Crusher and Warning Shot Skills (pages 205 and 219 of
the Core Rulebook).

after resolving the attack, the servant can perform a free attack with Dark Claws against that
creature.
Undead w The spectral servant is immune to poisoned and HP recovery may harm it (Core
Rulebook, page 305).
CERINE’S SERVANTS
If Cerine’s servants are guarding her hideout – perhaps a proper dungeon! – you can
add some variety to them so that the Player Characters can try different approaches
and the battles don’t get repetitive.
 Soldiers and mages. You can use the profiles of the Skeletal Mages and Skeletal
Soldiers (Core Rulebook, page 351), adapting their statistics to level 25 or 30. The
easiest solution is to give the mages a few extra spells and the soldiers the ability to
inflict status effects with their attacks.
 Ties to the past. Some of the servants might still wear clothing dating back to the
tragic events of Cerine and Cecilia’s lives. The Player Characters might pick up on this,
and connect Cerine to the legends about the sisters of Tarranorn. Also, if a PC hails
from present-day Tarranorn, it’s a good idea to let their Player fill in the blanks.

CHAPTER
OTHER TYPES OF CONFLICT
The statistics from the previous pages focus on combat-related conflicts. That doesn’t
mean it’s impossible to talk with Cerine – or Cecilia, once she is summoned – but it
does hint that both sisters mostly rely on force. After all, a long history of betrayal
has convinced them that words mean little in the face of the darkness that lurks in
people’s hearts.
CERINE’S RITE
An interesting aspect of creating a magical Villain like Cerine is wondering what her
power source could be. Here are some tips that you can adapt to the threats and
mysteries of your campaign:
 A magic formula that was stolen from one of the protagonists’ homelands.
 A rite that has endangered someone dear to the protagonists.
 An artifact like the Black Blood (Core Rulebook, page 289).
A LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS
In most high fantasy worlds, there’s no coming back from undeath and the
transformation into a lich: these acts irreparably destroy a person’s spirit and identity,
or twist their thoughts towards darkness.
However, Cerine and Cecilia have kept their personalities and consciences. Their
awareness makes them fearsome foes but also opens an avenue to dialogue, if not
even redemption – though this depends on Cerine’s actions throughout the campaign.
Notably, if the PCs show respect and compassion for the betrayal suffered by Cecilia, or
if they refuse to deliver a finishing blow against Cecilia or Cerine, the sisters might start
seeing them in a different light. To make such narrative and emotional developments
possible, Players should find out about Cerine and Cecilia’s past, for example via clues
or Game Master scenes and through dialogue during conflicts.

MAXIMILIAN

The Empire’s pride and joy, charismatic and brilliant second-born prince Maximilian
is possessed of immense talent in swordplay and diplomacy. Maximilian is a natural
leader, the paragon to which each Imperial citizen aspires, a living symbol of the
power and glory upholding Imperial vision.
His abilities have caused him to be the subject of countless favorable comparisons
with his older brother, the Crown Prince – a cause of no slight tension. Yet Maximilian
has no ambitions for the throne: he is content to let his brother deal with the monotony
of governance, while he furthers the Empire’s interests in the continent.
All who have witnessed Maximilian on the battlefield describe him as dignified, just,
and calm: an exemplary warrior. But this calmness is a mask, hiding his anxieties and
insecurities. Mindful of his position, he is careful to cultivate this façade, only allowing
it to slip in the presence of his armsmaster Nike and his childhood friend Theo, his
companions in countless marches and battles.

ANTAGONISTS
CHAPTER
MAXIMILIAN’S TACTICS
The first clash with Maximilian should be against his Prince variant (Champion 3,
worth 3 soldiers). In these cases, his strategies are:
 On his first turn of the first round, Maximilian casts Awaken to raise his Might. On the
first turn of every other round, he uses the Guard action to defend until the second turn,
and recovers from all status effects save enraged.
 On his second and third turns, Maximilian uses Smash Through or, if the effect of
Awaken has been removed, he casts it again to increase his Might. If he is out of Mind
Points, Maximilian performs Shield Bash on the second turn and Bronze Sword on
the third.
If the fight takes place outside the Imperial Capital, Maximilian saves all his Ultima
Points except one for Escaping in case of defeat.
If the fight happens in the capital, once Maximilian is defeated he takes his second
form: Bastion (Champion 2, equal to 2 soldiers). When this happens, Nike and Theo
(pages 188 and 189) join the fray by his side.
 In his first turn of the first round, Maximilian uses Raise the Banner. Then he cyclically
goes through a specific routine of actions in the following turns: Exploding Charge,
Elemental Charge, Piercing Charge, and finally an attack with Conviction, using all
the buffs accrued. After the attack, the cycle starts again from Exploding Charge.
If Maximilian is in Crisis, he instead uses a random Charge and then uses Dire
Times to attack. If he doesn’t have enough Mind Points, he simply attacks with
Conviction instead.
 Nike uses the Guard action to cover Maximilian, using Protect to soak up the blows
against him.
 Theo casts Heal, mainly on Maximilian, but also on himself or Nike if they are in
Crisis. If the enemy relies on a specific type of damage, Theo casts Elemental Shroud
on himself and his allies to alleviate the damage. If Maximilian is at full health and
no allies are in Crisis, Theo casts Ventus or attacks with his caduceus.
During this battle, Maximilian spends Ultima Points recklessly to succeed on Checks
or recover Mind Points on his turn.

SPECIAL RULES
Divide and Conquer w After a creature misses Nike with a melee attack, that creature suffers
slow immediately after resolving the attack.

Protection w Nike can swap places with an endangered creature, as per the Protect Skill (Core
Rulebook, page 197).
Shield of the Empire w As long as Maximilian’s banner stands, Nike reduces all damages she
takes by 5, before applying Affinities.
Thundering Blow w When a creature hits Nike with a melee attack, after resolving the attack,
Nike can immediately perform a free attack with Twin Shields against that creature. If she does,
the attack doesn’t have multi (2) and the High Roll is considered to be 0 when determining
damage.
FACE THE TRUTH
Maximilian is a double-faced Villain: he is both a heroic and honorable prince and an
insecure man hiding behind a mask of gold and glory.
Regardless, Nike and Theo feel genuine affection for Maximilian. If forced to discuss
the topic, they may admit to being worried about the prince, who is crushed by
expectations and obsessed with the Empire’s cultural and military expansion. Also,
Theo’s compassionate nature has made him question the Empire’s policies more
than once.
Though loyal to Maximilian, Nike and Theo might seek a discussion with the PCs – an
action that the prince, in his prideful arrogance, could consider outright treason.

TRAGEDIA
W
A wise princess, forced into a life of crime and piracy.
A kind mage, cursed to lose form and reason, and forced to soar the skies as a dragon.
A brave heroine, betrayed by her country and left to die in the muck.
A devout priestess, who gave up her humanity in the throes of grief.
A young prince, driven by duty and ambition to stain his hands with the blood of
countless innocents.
History is rife with heroic tales, whose fate ultimately proves tragic. Many wonder why
it should be so...
Why, because the story itself demands it!
When the enemy lies vanquished, and evil is banished from the known lands, it is not
comfort nor solace that await the hero at journey’s end, only suffering and death.
This is a fact so inevitable and cruel that many attribute it to some unseen writer
weaving threads of fate towards mournful ends – ruin incarnate.
The few bards who dare sing of this entity call it Tragedia.
“Someday, somehow, your footsteps will lead you before
Tragedia. By its decree, your story shall reach its conclusion.
Will you be content with it? Will you accept this ending,
this heart-wrenching demise?
Or will you once again challenge fate ordained, snatching
the quill from those inexorable hands?
Now more than ever, the stage is yours... Heroes.”

BASIC ATTACKS
$ Transcendental Spike w【 MIG + WLP】 +6 w【 HR + 20】 physical damage. In addition, the next
time the target takes damage from any source, that source deals 20 extra damage to them.
OTHER ACTIONS
S Wheel of Fate w Randomly choose one of the available Villains for Mimesis to embody – it
can’t be the Villain embodied in the last turn. Then, if Mimesis has embodied all the available
Villains at least once, it gains 1 Destiny, up to a maximum of 5 (to use Destiny, see Apocrypha,
Red String Aegis and Final Clash below).
REGOLE SPECIALI
Apocrypha w When Mimesis performs an attack, that attack gains the multi (Mimesis’ current
Destiny) property. If the attack already had multi, this property increases by the amount of
Mimesis’ current Destiny.
Echoes of Fate w Mimesis gains all the Traits, Affinities, basic attacks, and Spells of the Villain
it embodies.
If that Villain is level 19 or lower, attacks and spells obtained this way deal 15 extra damage;
if they are level 39 or lower, the extra damage is 10 instead; if they are level 59 or lower, the
extra damage is 5 instead.
Basic attacks and Affinities granted by the Villain’s equipment are also imitated, and their
equipment can’t be destroyed or stolen.
Mimesis always uses the embodied Villain’s formulas when performing Accuracy or Magic
Checks – for example, if it embodies Maximilian, the Prince (page 184), it uses【 DEX + MIG】
+4 for Shield Bash and【 DEX + MIG】 +5 for Bronze Sword.
Final Clash w When Mimesis attacks or casts an offensive spell (r), if that attack or spell targets
one or more creatures that have a Bond towards the Villain that Mimesis is embodying, Mimesis
gains a bonus to its Accuracy or Magic Checks equal to its current Destiny.
Flying w See the Core Rulebook, page 307.
Red String Aegis w When a creature deals damage to Mimesis, that damage is reduced by an
amount equal to Mimesis’ current Destiny.

ANTAGONISTS
CHAPTER
TRAGEDIA’S TACTICS: MIMESIS
In its first phase, Tragedia takes the guise of Mimesis, a being that can partially
replicate the abilities of the antagonists who have appeared during the campaign.
Before the session, the Game Master must select a number of Villains from those
faced during the Campaign equal to the number of Player Characters. Ideally, each
of these Villains should be connected thematically or story-wise to at least one PC.
 In its first turn of every round, Mimesis uses Wheel of Fate to embody one of the
Villains chosen by the GM, completely altering its appearance.
 In its second turn of each round, Mimesis uses one of the actions available to the
Villain it embodies, focusing its attention on the Player Characters with whom that
Villain had a connection.
 In the third turn of every round, Mimesis uses Transcendental Spike against the
Player Character with the highest current HP.
This phase has two main objectives:
 Recall past battles, allowing the Players to use the information they gathered in
previous conflicts to face this new, powerful adversary.
 Bring back emotional memories from the entire arc of the campaign. Mimesis will
distort the Villains it embodies, turning them into caricatures who mock the PCs.
Mimesis should speak freely during this phase, and the Game Master should invite the
Players to respond in kind, showing off their characters’ emotions.
When Mimesis reaches 0 Hit Points, Tragedia shifts into its second phase: Anagnorisis
(see next page). The conflict scene doesn’t end, but the current round does, and you’ll
need to reroll Initiative.

BASIC ATTACKS
$ Interpolation w【 MIG + WLP】 +6 w【 HR + 20】 physical damage. Damage dealt by this attack
ignores all Affinities except Resistances. If this attack causes one or more Player Characters to
enter Crisis, fill 1 section of the “Predestination” Clock.
SPECIAL RULES
Death of the Author w Anagnorisis is immune to poisoned and enraged.
Dramatis Personae w When a creature deals damage to Anagnorisis, that damage is reduced by
an amount equal to the total strength of that creature’s Bonds.
Fourth Wall w As long as the dramatist’s quill (to the right) is not in Crisis, Anagnorisis is
Immune to all damage types. The Game Master must describe this effect as some kind of barrier,
and must describe the barrier failing when the dramatist’s quill enters Crisis.
TRAGEDIA’S TACTICS: ANAGNORISIS
Tragedy now manifests as Anagnorisis, the manipulator of destiny, accompanied by
the dramatist’s quill (see right).
 Create a thirteen-section Clock with 4 sections already filled. This Clock works as
usual, but without the option of using an opportunity to fill 2 sections – you can use
one to erase 2 sections, though.
If the Clock reaches 13, remove it from the scene. Then, all PCs lose 9999 Hit Points
and the Game Master places a piece of paper with the words “Fin?” on the table. If
one of the PCs decides to Sacrifice, their Player can tear up the paper: this allows all
companions to recover all HP, MP, and IP and recover from all status effects.
 Every turn, Anagnorisis uses Interpolation on the Player Character with the highest
current HP.
When Anagnorisis reaches 0 Hit Points, Tragedia shifts into its third and final phase:
Catharsis (page 196). Remove the dramatist’s quill and the Predestination Clock from
the scene. The conflict doesn’t end, but the current round does, and you’ll need to
reroll Initiative.

OTHER ACTIONS
S As Ordained by Fate... w The quill can use an action to command a Player Character to take
one of the actions below on their turn, determined by rolling a d6. If the character follows
orders, even if just as part of another action, they gain 1 Fabula Point and fill 1 section of the
Predestination Clock, otherwise, they lose 20 HP and 20 MP.
(1-2) ... Thy Sword Smites Thy Comrades: the creature must deal damage to another creature
chosen by the quill.
(3-4) ... Thou Hast Mercy for Thine Enemy: the creature must make one or more of their
enemies recover HP, increase one or more of their Attribute die sizes, or have them recover
from one or more status effects.
(5-6) ... Thou Hast Ruin to Thy Comrades Brought: the creature must inflict one or more
status effects on their allies.
S Exeunt w The quill can use an action and spend 50 MP to immediately end all status effects
and all other effects that would last till the end of the scene, including spells.
SPECIAL RULES
Elemental w The quill is immune to poisoned.
In the Next Episode... w When the quill reaches 0 Hit Points, if the Predestination Clock has 2
or more filled sections, the quill comes back to life with 90 HP, and 2 sections of the Clock are
erased. When this happens, all Player Characters receive 2 Fabula Points.
TRAGEDIA’S TACTICS: DRAMATIST’S QUILL
On its turn, the quill always uses As Ordained by Fate… to cause a random effect (roll
1d6) on a random target, but it never chooses the same effect twice in a row – that
would make for a boring story! If there are four or more status effects, spells, and/
or ongoing effects in play with effects that are beneficial to the PCs, the quill instead
uses Exeunt to remove them. If it doesn’t have enough MP and is not in Crisis, it uses
Thus They Suffered a Grievous Wound… on a random target – otherwise, it performs
As Ordained By Fate... like usual.

BASIC ATTACKS
$ Slow Epilogue w【 MIG + WLP】 +6 w【 HR + 20】 damage. This attack has multi (3). Damage
dealt by this attack has no type, thus ignoring Affinities.
OTHER ACTIONS
S Abyssal Agony w Catharsis can use an action to emit a horrible wail that strikes fear in all
who hear it. All creatures except Catharsis suffer dazed, shaken, slow, and weak. When this
happens, any PC may spend 1 Fabula Point to negate the effects of this action, describing what
they say or do to stand up to the wave of terror.
S Divine Frenzy w Catharsis can use an action to launch an endless barrage of blows, reducing
the HP and MP of all its enemies to 1. When this happens, any PC may spend 1 Fabula Point
to negate the effects of this action, describing what they say or do to defend their allies from
Catharsis’ onslaught.
SPECIAL RULES
Bonds that Transcend Destiny w When a Player Character deals damage to Catharsis, they deal
extra damage equal to the total strength of their Bonds.
Catharsis w When Catharsis enters Crisis for the first time, it explodes in a burst of Fabula
Points. Each Player Character receives 15 Fabula Points; then, all of Catharsis’ Resistances
become Vulnerabilities, and Slow Epilogue loses its +6 bonus to Accuracy Checks.
Divine Tribute w When Catharsis deals damage to a Player Character, that character suffers
extra damage equal to their current Fabula Points.
SEEMS A BIT MUCH
The battle with Catharsis assumes that the Player Characters have some Fabula
Points left from the previous phases and can withstand Slow Epilogue’s damage –
they should be level 50, after all. If the situation gets bleak, the Game Master can
partially or entirely restore the group’s strength: narratively speaking, this effect
should be connected to the intervention of some magical entity the group aided
during the campaign.

ANTAGONISTS
CHAPTER
TRAGEDIA’S TACTICS: CATHARSIS
After beating Tragedia’s “façade” phases, the Player Characters can now behold the
being’s dark core (see the image on page 185). This form channels Tragedia’s lust for
agony and deep-seated fear of not being truly all-powerful and eternal.
 On its first turn of each odd round, Catharsis uses Abyssal Agony, and on its first turn
of each even round, it uses Divine Frenzy.
 On its second and third turns of each round, Catharsis uses Slow Epilogue, focusing
on the targets with the highest current HP.
Once Catharsis enters Crisis, the fight is mostly over: use the remaining rounds as a
“victory lap” to honor the campaign’s finale.
When Catharsis reaches 0 Hit Points, Tragedia loses all remaining Ultima Points and
starts dissolving.
Since Catharsis is now a regular NPC, the Players can determine its fate. This is the
culmination of the group’s story, so don’t be afraid to go overboard! The heroes have
earned the right to write their own finale.
TO APEX AND BEYOND
Tragedia is an excellent example of “metanarrative” boss who acts as the epic
conclusion to a High Fantasy tale: if the whole campaign was a battle between
worldviews, then the fight against Tragedia becomes an allegory of the daily struggle
for the right to exist authentically, as human beings with our own identity and not as
the result of someone else’s narration, expectations or beliefs.
 This type of battle will often carry profound implications and may strike very
personal chords. The group is responsible for managing the intensity of the scene
and everyone’s emotional involvement, course-correcting on the fly if necessary.
 When you create a boss like this, ask yourself a fundamental question: “what was our
campaign about?”. There won’t always be a clear-cut answer, but it’s important for
each Player Character to glimpse a part of themselves in this last battle for the fate
of reality itself.
