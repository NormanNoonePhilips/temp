INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER
A fight with no quarter awaits you in the Fabula Ultima Techno Fantasy Atlas!
This expansion of the Core Rulebook focuses on a genre mainly characterized by hightech
and dystopian worlds, outcast heroes fighting against inequalities, and ruthless
antagonists ready to go to any length to preserve their privileges.
This Atlas differs from the Core Rulebook both in terms of its aesthetics – which are tied to
science fiction – and the darker tones and situations presented, closer to the dystopian genre
and real-world conflicts. Strong themes like authoritarianism and media manipulation will
be central to it. Therefore, we recommend paying special attention to discussions about
tone, themes, and safety at the game table (see Core Rulebook, pages 146–147).
Besides offering a brief introduction to the way we envision the techno fantasy genre,
the Atlas provides advice and game materials for the Game Master and additional rules
for Players, all in three simple chapters:
 The World provides valuable elements for creating techno fantasy settings, including
10 archetypal locations you can use as campaign elements or for inspiration, plus
a list of new rare items and artifacts ideal for science fiction and, finally, rules for
clashes between mecha, armored vehicles, and much more!
 The Protagonists introduces 3 new Classes (Esper, Mutant, and Pilot). It also provides
several optional rules (such as those for technospheres) to give the game a futuristic
and post-industrial feel.
 The Antagonists chapter focuses on 5 Villains – pregenerated Bosses, each more
fearsome than the last – that embody the many facets of techno fantasy evil.
This Atlas doesn’t presume to be a complete guide to the techno fantasy genre in all
its shades, and some sections are connected more closely than others to their authors’
creative and philosophical inclinations: their goal is to provide advice and examples
from the inspirational works (see page 215), useful both to those well-versed in this
genre, and especially to those who have recently found their way to Fabula Ultima
and JRPGs in general.

WHAT DEFINES FABULA ULTIMA’S TECHNO FANTASY?
In this volume, and more generally in Fabula Ultima, the term “techno fantasy”
indicates a series of specific elements that we consider typical of a particular narrative
and setting style.
In brief, we are discussing the authors’ personal visions, which do not claim to be the
absolute truth. Indeed, narrative genres have nebulous boundaries, and it would be
impossible – maybe even irresponsible – to box them in too much.
What follows may help you to better understand the creative roots behind this book!
» INJUSTICE AND DESPAIR
Though all of Fabula Ultima’s worlds have dark facets, the techno fantasy style pushes
this element to the extreme: from cold and dystopian megacities to multinational
corporations seizing control of what should be universal human rights, from the
destruction of entire planets and ecosystems to the violent and systematic repression
of dissent – in these worlds, even imagining a brighter future is challenging.
Techno fantasy worlds are intricate and complex – it’s not easy to distinguish truth
from lies, and most of the population, robbed of everything, even the right to hope, just
tries to survive until the end of the day.
» OUTCASTS, SOONER OR LATER
Techno fantasy protagonists cannot find a place in society and are usually perceived
as dangerous and destabilizing. These heroes reject the dynamics of opportunism
and exploitation that uphold their worlds and put their own lives on the line to
defend others, knowing full well that the true purpose of laws and security forces is
to protect those in power. Step by step, the Player Characters contest the idea that
the status quo is truly inevitable and immutable, and openly challenge governments,
multinationals, and criminal cartels who toy with the fates of countless people.
Though it’s legitimate to bring characters from privileged classes into play, it’s crucial
that they have forsaken their origins or are trying to sabotage the system from within
– which will inevitably lead them to be seen as traitors by their peers. No Player
Character should have an easy life.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER » BETWEEN CONCRETE AND EXISTENTIAL
What makes techno fantasy stories intense and memorable is their dual nature: they
feature extremely tangible tragedies and dangers – such as environmental exploitation,
imperialism, discrimination, and repression – and they eventually conclude with a struggle
between incompatible philosophies and opposed visions about the future of humanity,
not to mention the means through which humankind may transcend its current condition.
Player Characters represent defiance in this struggle, building connections of acceptance,
mutual support, and a search for freedom and justice, while Villains concentrate as
much power as possible in their hands, elevating themselves above anyone else, pushed
by arrogance, greed, and an obsession for control.
» MAIN REFERENCES
Here are some titles that shaped the artistic vision of this book:
 Final Fantasy VII is probably the most well-known and emblematic techno fantasy
JRPG and contains many of the elements described in this book. It’s a story about
fighting inequality and deeply insecure and traumatized heroes and antagonists,
which alternates terrifying tragedy with lighter, more hopeful moments. The Remake
version, currently in progress, picks up the original story but leads it in a new direction
– thus, it can be a good idea to check out both.
 Xenogears is an undying classic: a tale with strong tones that strives to address
the horrors of war, segregation, and social and psychological manipulation. It’s an
ambitious and troubled project whose cast is mature and multifaceted, though it does
frequently stumble when dealing with religious iconography and is quite infamous for
the lack of gameplay during the second half of the game.
 Xenosaga has many of the same virtues and defects of the earlier Xenogears, but this
trilogy pushes the JRPG genre toward its technological extreme. It includes mecha, aliens
from other dimensions, androids with unlimited power, travel through virtual reality, and
battles between spaceships. It’s a great example of how much you could move away from
medieval fantasy aesthetics without betraying Fabula Ultima’s basic premise.
 Soul Hackers and Soul Hackers 2 fully embrace a mix of occultism and cyberspace:
manipulating souls and hacking into security systems are closely related processes, and
the network itself manifests in a similar way to a dungeon.
 Though not a JRPG, the world, characters, technologies, and aesthetics of Arknights
have deeply influenced much of this book’s contents.
“The outcome has been calculated. Further resistance
will be statistically irrelevant. Why insist, then?”

On page 14, Fabula Ultima’s Core Rulebook discusses the Eight Pillars that uphold its
entire game experience. This Atlas builds on those elements in its own way.
ANCIENT RUINS AND HARSH LANDS
This pillar remains almost unvaried in techno fantasy settings, though the harsh lands
might be replaced by areas contaminated by radiation, surveilled military zones, or
the turfs of organized crime. In some cases, your tales could even take place between
many planets instead of just on one, which introduces dangers tied to space travel.
The desolate sands are an expanse subject to desertification caused by the Extractors,
massive self-moving platforms that reap life force from the land.
Agroat, the capital of the Pleion System, is an ecumenopolis home to the Headquarters
of the Federation. Monstrous creatures created by the government’s experiments lurk
in its lower levels.
Mirai is a legendary underwater city that some believe was inhabited by alien people
with formidable, intelligent weapons.
A WORLD IN PERIL
Techno fantasy worlds are constantly under threat, though the danger might not
always be obvious. Sometimes, the threat is an insidious evil that has slowly but surely
led people to accept its role as a fundamental necessity in their lives, or even praise it
as a model to strive towards.
The Pale Fleet is a mysterious horde of alien ships that have arrived from deep space,
having reduced all planets on their path into charred husks.
Billionaire Lloyd Rand has used his family’s wealth to monopolize the entire aerospace
industry, getting rid of anyone who opposed his dream of creating a vessel capable
of traveling between dimensions. The public see Rand as a pioneer and visionary,
unaware of his scheme to fully drain the planet’s energy to reach a mysterious entity
he is obsessed with.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER CLASHING COMMUNITIES
In techno fantasy worlds, conflicts are carefully manipulated to ensure that the less
privileged sections of society do not join forces. The whole known world might even
be under the authority of a single organization or alliance, but this too will be a facade
hiding many tensions and rivalries.
The three gangs of the Crystalline Canyon are locked in a merciless war. The
gangs’ patriarchs stoke the hatred, bankrolled by the Hanneman Corporation. This
multinational sells weapons to all factions involved and aims, at some point, to
present the Assembly of Nations with a… radical solution. In exchange, all they ask for
is control over the region, which is rich in minerals.
Officially, Earth and its Colonies from Artemis to Enkelados are under the authority
of the Terran Empire, which also controls the development and trade of ExoMags,
mighty mecha which are attuned to their pilot’s spirit. However, a rebel group of
Mirandian independentists managed to seize a military ship with an experimental
ExoMag prototype onboard, known as Verdant Sabre. What power does it conceal?
EVERYTHING HAS A SOUL
This pillar may seem somewhat tough to reconcile with a colder and more high-tech
setting; however, it’s crucial for the stream of souls to remain central, even if it’s recast
with a sci-fi aesthetic.
The Moon of Energos is a legendary planetoid near the galactic core, where all the
spiritual energy of the universe flows from. Its location is unknown, and the portals
leading to it have been inactive for millennia.
Psychospace technology allows for the transmission of information over great
distances through the stream of souls. It’s a dimension where thoughts and words can
transmute into virtual demons that pose a very real danger.
Considered to be the Union’s main source of welfare, CradleCorp encourages conflicts
and violence in poor regions and uses the ensuing spiritual oscillation to generate
electrical energy. The process may well be destabilizing the planet’s elemental
balance, but the profits are excellent.
10
W
MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY
In a techno fantasy context, magic and technology should be deeply interconnected,
although there will often be some form of ancient and powerful magic that science
cannot fully comprehend.
The groups of diabolists fighting over NeonCity use occult firearms known as pentaguns,
which channel magical energy into bullets.
Larger spaceships use entropic inversion engines to bend space and time and travel
well over the speed of light, but smaller vessels have to rely on flux portals, which are
usually well-guarded by the armed forces of each system.
Ruleswise, it’s important that magic and Rituals can interact with tech and machinery –
which should thus be fueled by magical energy or similar resources.
HEROES OF MANY SIZES AND SHAPES
Techno fantasy’s sci-fi elements allow you to play androids, bizarre aliens, psychic
phantoms, and even experimental life forms; at the same time, many techno
fantasy heroes have names and past lives extremely close to those of our real and
contemporary world.
Vera Arkland was once an assassin for the Triumvirate, but is now on the run after
she refused to murder her target – another PC from the group! She wields a pair of
electrified daggers and has superhuman reflexes.
After the lab where he worked was assaulted by mercenaries from Luminous
Enterprise, brilliant scientist Yui Jiménez lent his expertise to the anti-authoritarian
organization Quake. For all intents and purposes, Yui is now considered a terrorist by
the world governments.
Gog, short for Gogarange, is one of the last surviving members of an ancient people of
highly intelligent fish whose home planet was rendered uninhabitable by the orbital
crystalline fusion cannons of the Moroz Protectorate. Gog has joined a group of rebel
heroes and is hell-bent on avenging the death of her loved ones. She uses a special
exoskeleton to survive out of water and handle her gear.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER IT’S ALL ABOUT THE HEROES
Respecting this pillar can be challenging in techno fantasy worlds where the Villains’
machinations extend over entire galaxies, supported by the very structures of society.
It’s important that both Game Master and Players do their best to make the Player
Characters central, whether because of their choices, their bonds with the antagonists,
or the possession of unique information, abilities, or artifacts.
Bounty hunters Closure and Astarte are famous for being cold and adamant
professionals. However, when they saw a young girl being chased by surveillance
squads from the Coevi IV federal lab, they acted on instinct and hid the girl inside
their ship. They do not know it yet, but this simple act has changed the fate of the
universe: the girl is able to attune with the stream of souls and communicate with
entities from other dimensions.
When General Arkhov invaded the Amber Archipelago, she ordered the extermination
of the hushblade monks, but one of them survived. Now, with a mask partially hiding
their face and a half-artificial body, the monk is recruiting fighters to stage a revolt.
If you ever realize that the Player Characters have no way to take significant action
during the campaign, do not hesitate to introduce new elements that would allow
them to do so, either via Fabula Points or the GM’s questions.
MYSTERY, DISCOVERY, AND GROWTH
In techno fantasy stories, the protagonists find themselves plumbing the depths of
the injustices and deceptions upon which their society is built. This process should
translate into strong personal growth and introspection, which is juxtaposed with the
main antagonists’ inability to repent, grow, and change.
Frederika Lansbury rebelled against her family and LansTech’s trade empire to join
a group of freedom fighters and activists. During the campaign, she will discover how
grotesque and perverted LansTech’s operations truly are, but also that she was naive
and conditioned due to the education she received.
Arriving before the alien queen within the depths of the Praxis bioship, our heroes
discover that the energy powering their own vessels is stolen from a parallel galaxy
where the Praxian people live, which is slowly dying as its lifeforce is drained.
“Redemption? We’re not here to redeem you
– we’re here to stop you.”

W
The following pages discuss some crucial aspects of participating in a techno fantasy
campaign with Fabula Ultima.
HEROES, DESPITE IT ALL
Usually, techno fantasy heroes have traumatic pasts and have disavowed society – or
were disavowed by it. Dark Themes such as Guilt, Doubt, Anger, and Vengeance are
extremely common, and it is likely that the Player Characters will kill one or more
adversaries during the campaign.
Remember, however, that you are playing heroes: though the PCs might rely on
drastic measures or take a life, these actions will shake them deeply – that’s the main
difference between them and techno fantasy Villains.
Make sure to discuss these topics carefully and agree upon the scene tone and the
level of violence you find acceptable in your campaign.
A BIT TOO CLOSE TO HOME
The techno fantasy genre explores scenes, lives, and themes extremely close to
those of the world today: war, imperialism, classism, discrimination, billionaires and
dictators able to commit crimes of all kinds without facing consequences, and much
more. Even combat often involves firearms, drones, and vehicles, evoking situations
that we are unfortunately familiar with and that one or more people at the table
may even have experienced firsthand.
As always, take care of those you play with: there’s nothing wrong with preferring a
world in which battles are fought between armies of magic-driven mecha wielding
bladed weapons if doing so allows you to approach and confront techno fantasy
themes from a safer distance, without reaching harmful levels of discomfort.
REMEMBER TO BREATHE
We’ve already addressed the fact that techno fantasy tends to be the bleakest play
style in Fabula Ultima; that is precisely why you should take time to play scenes in
which the Player Characters rest, joke, and take care of one another, showcasing the
hopes and dreams that they fight for. Try to keep a rhythm that alternates between
moments of tension and moments of levity.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER AGAINST THE WORLD
In most Fabula Ultima campaigns, Villains act with egoism, obsession, or cruelty in
a world that is often aware of the evil in their actions. This is not the case in techno
fantasy: society has surrendered to the Villains or directly supports them, while law
and police reforces merely represent futher weapons in their arsenal.
It is the Player Characters, and not the Villains, who are “undesirable”.
The consequence is that the heroes cannot trust any form of power, authority, or
surveillance, and many of the people they encounter will strongly consider betraying
them to gain favor with the establishment. Any person who tries to aid the PCs is
making a great effort and putting themselves in grave danger.
The path of techno fantasy heroes is littered with loss and sacrifice, and they will need
to seek comfort in each other to avoid losing hope. The Game Master should consider
these factors when applying the consequences for Surrendering.
TECHNO, BUT STILL FANTASY
When dealing with futuristic settings, power plants, and modern equipment, it may be
tempting to apply academic logic and the principles of physics to the characters’ plans
and the description of scenes – especially if someone in your group studies or works
in these fields. However, this would be a terrible idea. You are still in a JRPG, where
scientific terms and theories are plot devices that contribute to an aesthetic, and
heroes continue to face obstacles following the logic of a fantasy narrative. Use these
devices to make a scene more impressive, but do not worry about them too much,
and, most of all, do not forget that magic should interact with all these technologies!
MANAGING INFLUENCES
Works of science fiction have a tendency to rely on concepts and terms derived from
philosophy, anthropology, and religion to give their locations, characters, and events
an aura of importance and mysticism. Drawing inspiration from a wide variety of
thinkers and cultures is undoubtedly stimulating, but it’s important to find sources
that cover their topics with awareness and without distorting or stereotyping
them. Moreover, make sure that this content and references do not strike delicate
chords with other people at the table.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER This chapter provides a bird’s eye view of Fabula Ultima’s approach to techno fantasy
worlds. Both Players and Game Masters are welcome to read it – it contains valuable
tools for both roles.
The chapter is constructed as follows:
TECHNO FANTASY LOCATIONS
This section helps you create techno fantasy areas, worlds, and even planets. It also
provides ten in-depth examples of techno fantasy locations, each detailed first as a
narrative archetype, and then as a collection of playable hooks.
CONFLICTS
This section explores techno fantasy conflicts from both narrative and rules perspectives.
MAGIC AND RITUALS
This section delves into the role of magic in techno fantasy worlds and considers how
magic interacts with technology.
TECHNOLOGY
This section provides advice on managing the “tech” of techno fantasy worlds,
including space travel, airships, and clashes between vehicles.
RARE ITEMS AND ARTIFACTS
The chapter’s last two sections focus on rare items and artifacts you might find in a
techno fantasy setting. As well as general advice, there are also a number of readyto-
use item lists.
THE WORLD
16
W
During World Creation (see Core Rulebook, page 148) and during play sessions, you
will often be called upon to introduce new regions, settlements, or points of interest.
This section contains advice and suggestions and discusses the mindset to adopt
when creating techno fantasy locations, and then provides ten examples you can use
in your campaigns or draw upon for inspiration.
INEQUALITY AND OPPRESSION
The most important thing to remember when you imagine or describe a techno
fantasy location is that it should be connected to one or more forms of inequality and
oppression. Sometimes, the location embodies these elements through metaphors;
otherwise, it presents one of the parties involved within the dynamics of exploitation,
control, and repression.
 Above and below. This type of location is divided into two macro sections, one of
which exercises power over the other. It could be a metropolis built on two levels,
where the rich and privileged castes live in luxury, while most of the population is
trapped in slums where the light of day never shines. Another example is a planet
occupied by a colonizing military force.
 One of the parts. This is the most common option: the location is already under the
full control of an antagonist, who uses it as a base of operations for the next phase of
their plan. Alternatively, the location could be threatened by an overwhelming force
and need protection.
We might say that techno fantasy locations follow one main rule:
If a place is completely safe from the Villains’ schemes and it does not represent either
a victim or an oppressor, then it still needs some work. It is fine if the inhabitants are
simply unaware of what is going on… but the truth should emerge during play!
However, remember that it is not just the Game Master who has the right and
responsibility to create, describe and enrich locations and areas in interesting ways –
Players should also provide this kind of input during play. For instance, a Player could
spend a Fabula Point to discover clues that indicate that the hyper-technological
town’s prosperity is based on the exploitation of disposable labor.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
START WITH A BANG
Techno fantasy stories usually start in a situation rife with tension and urgency, where
the Villains have already enacted the initial phase of their plans. They now aim to
consolidate their power, escalating towards even more heinous cruelties, all in the
name of personal goals for which they are ready to sacrifice countless lives.
These stories tend to maintain a high level of tension from start to finish, though the
final locations and events should be more awe-inspiring and contain greater fantastic
elements than the initial ones.
For example, the campaign might start with the theft of a special prototype from a
corporate factory and end with a breathtaking battle amid the floating skyscrapers
of a megalopolis reshaped by psychic energy, in an attempt to stop an alien entity
brought into this world by a ruthless megalomaniac billionaire.
However, as explained on page 12, remember to include moments of respite between
missions, so that both the Players and the Player Characters can catch a breather.
VARIABLE SCALE
As a genre, techno fantasy is well suited for campaigns with a variety of different
scales, which might even encompass entire galaxies. Here are some examples of how
a consideration of scale can influence the creation of both the map and the world:
 Ecumenopolis. The campaign takes place on a completely urbanized planet: the
various neighborhoods and districts become locations, cities, and nations – you need
to make travel rolls to move between them.
 Homogeneous planets. In full space opera style, the campaign unfolds on many
planets, but each of them contains a single ecosystem or point of interest. In this
case, each planet becomes one location on the map, and the solar system or galaxy
becomes the “world”.
 Multiple maps. The campaign extends over different planets and solar systems, each
using separate maps to track movement on various scales – galactic, interplanetary,
and planetary. The risk here is that things get too complicated, without actually
adding much benefit to the gameplay experience.
You can find more information on travel and space maps on page 78.
18
W
TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY
Predictably, technology plays a crucial part in techno fantasy: it’s not just an aesthetic
element but a symbolic and thematic one as well. Technology offers power and control
and can turn even magic into a “mass-produced” industrial product. Different locations
should showcase different uses and forms of technology in the hands of allies and
enemies alike.
For example, in an oppressive megalopolis, technology could be cold and inhuman,
all robot patrols and faceless drones. However, for a colony of asteroid miners, tech is
an ally on which the communities’ survival depends, and to which all members have
equal access.
The fundamental point is that technology is not intrinsically good or bad, but
rather a tool through which we will express the values, desires, and fears of various
communities and cultures that populate the campaign, who might use that technology
in constructive or destructive ways.
THE SEED OF REBELLION
Another crucial aspect of techno fantasy locations is that each of them should contain
some form of potential or ongoing rebellion against those in power. These do not
necessarily need to be active, organized rebel cells, it might just be the efforts of
isolated individuals who are fighting for a brighter future, hoping to contain or
sabotage the oppressors’ progress.
For example, a senator from the Federation’s capital planet might be collecting
secret funds to finance autonomous guerrilla groups. Or, in a vast metropolis ruled by
corporations, an illegal clinic could offer refuge and medical attention to those who
cannot access corporate privileges.
Obviously enough, these elements should never make the Player Characters
irrelevant to the situation. Simply put, each location will be home to some people
who have long awaited the arrival of someone who shares their ideals and who can
help them finally fight back.
Likewise, if the PCs should fail or break their word, some of these allies could react,
becoming antagonists themselves.

USING THE SAMPLE LOCATIONS
The following pages contain ten complete techno fantasy locations, which you can
draw ideas from or place directly in your campaign, both during and after World
Creation – for example, when traversing an unexplored map region.
Each location entry is structured as follows:
 At a glance. This section provides a synopsis of the location: its keywords, the themes
it symbolizes, the terrain around it, and its elemental forces, as well as suggestions
for dangers and discoveries in the area.
 Questions for the group. In Fabula Ultima, you should not introduce elements
disconnected from the group. These questions give depth to the location and allow
Players to have creative input. Usually, the Game Master will ask the questions – and
they should make it a habit of doing so even when introducing locations that do not
come from an Atlas.
 Typical features. This section provides examples of characters and other elements
that can typically be found in this sort of location. Feel free to take these and use
them in other similar locations of your own devising.
 Position. Here, you will find suggestions on where to place this type of location, both
geographically and in the campaign’s timeline – towards a campaign’s start or end,
for instance.
 The Villains’ plans. This section provides suggestions on why Villains might be
interested in this or similar locations.
 Story hooks. Lastly, this rich section details a list of points of interest ($), mysteries
(b), and help requests (?), which the Game Master can use in whole or in part
during play.
Players and Game Masters alike are welcome to read these sample locations – they
will help the group attune to the techno fantasy style, and can provide you with
inspiration when needed.
Do not take any of what follows as “canon” or “official” – you have full authority to
modify any of these places as you see fit!

THE HIDDEN PLANET
W
The faded memory of an almost forgotten people, Agathyon seems to be a planet
far removed from human influence. Nature reclaimed what had been stolen from it:
ancient ruins are all that remains of aeons long gone. However, under the surface, the
thrumming heart of the planet’s original civilization still beats, encased within selfmoving
tunnels and an intricate labyrinth of metal and light.
Agathyon
AGATHYON AT A GLANCE
Keywords: exploration, primordial knowledge, secrets.
Terrain: forest, metal, unknown energy. Common elements: b E
Travel roll: d8, d10, d12. Rare elements: f a
Dangers: structural failures in the ruins, distortions in space, a steel titan
guarding a forgotten entryway.
Discoveries: an unusual weapon from the past, a secret lab containing a
holographic message, a hyperbaric chamber that heals wounds.
Themes: delving into the unknown, the origins of the world, a
power worth protecting.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Hidden Planet should include at least one of these features:
 A lab hiding the secrets of life’s origins.
 An ancient civilization that withdrew long ago, guarding a terrible secret.
 The mysterious techno-organic being that originated it all.
 A space-time anomaly that hides the planet from the rest of the universe.
» POSITION
Agathyon’s structure makes it an ideal turning point: the sudden discovery of the
planet’s secret might be the spark that sets the campaign’s events into motion. Equally,
Agathyon could easily be the final destination where the group can recover an artifact
capable of stopping the Villains’ plans. But beware – returning to the Hidden Planet
will be near impossible; it is best to decide wisely when to visit it.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
All those who crave power desire Agathyon. A major Villain – perhaps one ready to
escalate once they get their hands on the hidden secret – probably aspires to reach
the planet. Likewise, a major or supreme Villain might be the one controlling the
power hidden in this location, so that no one can oppose their plan of universal
conquest or rebirth.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Many legends revolve around the secrets that pushed this planet’s inhabitants to
conceal it from the rest of the universe. What are the most widespread theories?
 Many have traveled in search of the mysteries that Agathyon guards. Did
someone reach this place before you? What became of its inhabitants?
 What distinguishing marks were left by the ancient civilization that lived on this
planet? Which of them are still visible in other peoples across the universe?
 Although the planet appears to be abandoned, some creatures have
survived the extinction. What are they like?
 What defensive mechanisms were installed to protect this
place’s ancient knowledge?
22
W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Agathyon into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE LOST CITY
Beneath the thick canopy enshrouding the entire planet one can still find signs of
progress made by a civilization that was never truly forgotten.
 The observatory. This structure towers over the lost city; within it lies a huge hightech
astrolabe, several machines for charting space travel, and a holo-planetarium
representing the known universe. Where do its routes lead? What were the planet’s
inhabitants monitoring?
 The thoroughfare. Once brimming with life, this road is now constantly patrolled by
Hexabots, large sentient constructs that seem to have forgotten their original purpose.
What was it? How do they behave towards the characters? Do they share some
technological elements with the characters’ homeworld?
 The place of knowledge. A huge labyrinth of databases and memory cards, only
accessible through neural plugins. It seems to contain readings on all living – and
nonliving – beings. Who guards – or once guarded – these archives? One room
contains a project for a Hexabot prototype similar to a human being, but the capsule
containing the experiment is empty. What happened to it?
 The plaza of heroes. A wide open space at the end of the main thoroughfare, where
several Hexabots lie prostrated in adoration. Metal statues standing in a semicircle
skirt the area: they portray warriors from an ancient conflict, among whom a fighter
wearing an alien gauntlet stands out. A strange digital voice drones from the gauntlet.
If touched, it can take the shape of any weapon. Who are the heroes honored here?
Who does the voice belong to?
b LOST KNOWLEDGE
Whatever the secret was, the people of Agathyon clearly did all they could to protect
it. Why then, did they fade out of existence, ceasing to guard it?
 The living cemetery. An austere place full of capsules stored in lines and stacked
on top of each other. Each holds a body in permanent stasis. What features do the
creatures within have? Why did they choose such a fate?

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Prime. This ghostly, empty husk, the wandering remains of the first being in existence,
roams the planet dragging its weary limbs. Guided by voices within the stream of
souls, they are constantly searching for new minds to learn from, in an effort to
reconstruct their past. Prime is an elite-rank creature who can summon Effigies of the
past by drawing from the memories of their material life – in combat, a new soldierrank
Effigy joins the scene at the end of each round, up to a maximum number of
Effigies equal to half the number of PCs. Prime can inflict the dazed status with their
blows and continuously changes the weapon type with which they attack, preferring
to deal damage to the target’s Mind Points rather than Hit Points. Prime Absorbs
bolt damage and Resists earth damage but is Vulnerable to light and dark damage.
 No way out. The characters are doomed to clash with Prime indefinitely unless
they figure out how to stop the loop: Prime knows how to do so, but how can the
creature be convinced to reveal the solution? And why does Prime want to stop the
protagonists from uncovering Agathyon’s secrets?
? ABANDONED
The Player Characters’ devices pick up a strange signal, but it is hard to track its origin.
Someone seems to be trapped in one of the planet’s buildings!
 Twin buildings. These huge, decaying buildings hide the remains of ancient
experiments. They once belonged to Proto Corp, a well-known firm that developed
new technologies. However, the buildings housed rival research teams with vastly
different philosophies: how did they differ? Why were the buildings abandoned?
 Alone. The signal comes from a weapon abandoned in one of the labs. The object
contains Helyzia, an artificial Arcanum created by Proto Corp in an attempt to imbue
the power of the Arcana directly into human bodies. What gifts does it grant its
wielder? Discarded by her creators, Helyzia fears for her twin Zheliya, who could
become a terrible threat in the wrong hands. Sadly, Helyzia does not know if her twin
is still on the planet or was moved elsewhere. Where is Zheliya? Who took her?
 Towards new horizons. The research might lead the PCs into Agathyon’s bowels,
or towards galaxies far away. In each case, Helyzia can lend the PCs her powers in
exchange for help. She becomes an artifact for those who wield her or bind her like a
true Arcanum: what abilities does she grant? What side effects do they cause?
“Knowledge and understanding unlock all doors,
but the wrong hands may open that which should remain shut.”

DWELLING OF THE GODS
W
A flying megalopolis crafted from gilded steel; its mere passage blots out the sun.
Gazing up at it from below, it is natural to wonder what kind of life its privileged
inhabitants might live. After all, the only way to dwell aboard Axis is through one’s own
birthright - none can otherwise earn permission to visit the floating city, especially as
the Home of the Gods never sinks so low as to touch the planet’s ground.
Axis
AXIS AT A GLANCE
Keywords: austerity, elitism, mystery, technocracy.

Travel roll: d6, d10. Rare elements: f E
Dangers: a checkpoint with genetic identification systems, someone finds out
that the PCs are intruders and calls the authorities.

accessories, a repenting inhabitant.
Themes: discrimination, classism, bioessentialism, amoral and
genocidal science.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Dwelling of the Gods should include at least one of these features:
 A symbol representing the city or nation, flaunted everywhere.
 Harsh laws, expressed paternalistically and justified by the system.
 A shameless governor, cold and without ethics.
 Futuristic architecture, functional and minimalist.
» POSITION
At the start, it may be unthinkable for the Player Characters to enter a place like Axis –
there’s too much security, too many enemies and ruthless surveillance. They are more
likely to explore the city during the second half of the campaign or just before its end.
The protagonists’ moral virtues could be quickly discounted, contested by dogmas that
lodge deep within the inhabitants’ minds. But this trial might let the group show the
world that they are the subversive heroes this era really needs.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
A place like Axis could be both the lair or weapon of a Villain – perhaps someone
born in the city and who believes they are its rightful heir – or a tool desired by many
factions who are ready to plunder its technology. As the campaign unfolds, Axis might
even be destroyed by those eager to punish its inhabitants’ pride or conquered by a
supreme Villain who manipulates the city’s cruel ambitions to stage a coup.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Do any of you descend from the people of Axis or have you dealt with them in
the past?
 How did you infiltrate the city? What do you see in the glares of its inhabitants?
 What habits of the city’s people surprise you the most? Why do they zealously
embrace the founder’s ruthless philosophy?
 Are there more or fewer inhabitants than you expected? How are they
divided within the city?
 What place in Axis is best protected? What is guarded there?
 How many security androids do you see around? What
extraordinary piece of equipment are they armed with?
26
W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Axis into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the story
by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE CENTRAL ACADEMY
Only the most brilliant minds, and those most faithful to the founder, may enter here.
Each wing hides secrets and cruel experiments.
 Only for the few. The more one plunges into this cold and sinister place, the more one
risks losing humanity and empathy. How did the PCs make it inside? What peculiar
detail sends shivers down each characters’ spines?
 Efficiency. An efficient and spartan architectural design is applied rigorously to all
spaces. The people that the PCs encounter are not dressed like normal citizens, but
wear the uniforms of different research teams. What department do they belong to?
Do they have distinctive behaviors?
 Scientific curiosity. Despite their haughtiness, the scholars of the Academy seem
especially curious about the PCs: they study their movements, mannerisms, and overall
behavior. However, the researchers do not seem interested in truly “understanding”
the PCs but rather in putting them to the test, as if to verify how much they can get
through before the inevitable misstep. How do they challenge them?
 A holographic manifesto. Holograms of Axis’ founder, known only as “the Father”,
decorate all levels of the building. Each projection is programmed to speak with those
who address it: they can provide advice, make observations, and sustain passionate
ideological conversations. Are they truly “just” holograms? What is the central tenet
of the Father’s philosophy?
b PROJECT EREBUS
A diabolical plan is secretly taking place in Axis. Project Erebus aims to destroy all life
forms on the planet, replacing them with something else…
 A slow poison. Axis’ scientists have discovered how to poison the stream of souls. It
is a slow process that eliminates all forms of rebellion and independence from the
human soul, making it amenable to subjugation and indoctrination. Who created this
technology? How do they intend to enact their plan?
W
27
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Submission. Because of Project Erebus, more and more people are deprived of their
emotions and desire to live, and end up living dampened lives. Is there a way to save
the people of the “world below” from seemingly inescapable enslavement?
 Perfect servants. Once the subjugation process is over, the inhabitants of the flying
city will finally be able to dominate masses of individuals, wholly dedicated to them,
who will welcome the people of Axis as uncontested gods and masters. How much
time remains before the end of free will?
 Deicide. Unknown to the Axian elite, a rebel group has discovered Project Erebus and
is secretly trying to stop the poisoning and save the unknowing “people below”. Who
are the members of this organization? How do they operate in the shadow of the
Dwelling of the Gods’ rigid surveillance?
? SOS
The Player Characters discover a cryptic – and antiquated! – SOS sent via Morse
code. Though the message is corrupted, the group manages to trace it to one of Axis’
neighborhoods.
 Missing persons. The signal was sent by doctor Kayla, a genius scientist from Earth,
who went missing long ago. She and her team were kidnapped from various locations
and brought to work in secret laboratories aboard the floating city. Luckily, Axis’
advanced surveillance devices cannot detect such an “obsolete” signal, and Kayla was
able to contact the PCs and guide them to her location. Where in the city is Kayla’s lab
located? Which other well-known scientist was imprisoned with the doctor?
 Arrogance. The people of Axis are certain that their prisoners cannot escape. What
security system or guards do they rely on? Which weak spot are they overlooking?
 Theory and practice. The doctor and her colleagues have an escape plan: to suddenly
activate the invention they are working on, the Quantum Teleporter. However, they
need the PCs to power up a generator in the lab’s basement first. What is the worst
danger that the group might encounter?
 Forever grateful. If the escape plan works, the scientist might offer to add new,
surprising special features to the group’s trusty vehicle. Perhaps it is just what they
need to flush out the Villain…
“Those who inhabit Axis think they are the sun, that they live like gods,
but all that is left in their wake is shadow and frost.”

BENTHAM COMPLEX AT A GLANCE
Keywords: labyrinth, oppression, imprisonment, terror.
Terrain: magma, metal, rock. Common elements: f a E
Travel roll: d10, d12. Rare elements: i l
Dangers: a “corrective” murderous machine, desperate prisoners ready to do
anything to scrap by, dangerous anti-escape traps.
Discoveries: a clever but abandoned escape plan, a terminal with detailed
information about the inmates, a skeleton key to access the Supervisor’s office.
Themes: the inability to fight back against the system, the violence
of an oppressive and authoritarian regime, person against person.
THE PENITENTIARY FORTRESS
Bentham
Complex
Surrounded by an anti-magic field, this vast penitentiary comprises over seventeen
subterranean levels. In contrast with its formal name, which many would find
unthreatening, the inmates suffer arbitrary and inhuman treatment: from their office
atop the tower, the Supervisor forces them to carry out brutal work in long, unforgiving
shifts and “disposes” of the less efficient teams in the lava lake beneath the facility.
29
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Penitentiary Fortress should include at least one of these features:
 A sense of suspicion and paranoia among the inmates.
 A despot director – who likely owes their position to connections – with access to a
privileged area.
 A speaker system that keeps the time by blaring out patriotic sermons.
 The constant threat of an awful death, which thwarts any rebellious instincts.
» POSITION
Bentham Complex may appear in different parts of the adventure: our heroes might
start their story breaking out of the prison or attempting to thwart a scheme aimed at
framing them and confining them here. They might also visit the Complex later during
the campaign, perhaps to save another PC captured after Surrendering.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
If the Villain represents institutionalized power, this is the perfect place for their
despotic nature to fully reveal itself – a representation of the world they desire, where
they can crush at will any who oppose them. If, instead, the Villain is a product of
power, Betham Complex may be connected to their past or act as a recruitment base
for future accomplices, whom the Villain saves from “a cruel and unjust sentence”
thanks to the right words and resources.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Do you know someone imprisoned here? Who are they? Under which
accusations were they arrested and sent to the Complex?
 What is your plan of entry? How do you think you will escape?
 How does the anti-magic field manifest? Who or what is in charge of
its maintenance?
 What continuous sound do you hear once you are inside? What can you hear,
instead, in the rare moments of quiet?
 Have any of you caused someone to be incarcerated in Bentham
without knowing what happened within?
 Which of you lost a loved one to the Penitentiary Fortress?
30
W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Bentham Complex into play, the GM may use the following points to
enrich the story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE SIXTH FLOOR
This is where Espers and those capable of using magic and Arcana are detained. The
area is accessible only by the Supervisor and a few officials but forbidden to anyone else.
 A vice-like grip. This special floor of the fortress overhangs the sea of lava and is
supported only by a metal arm. The constant and disquieting creaking noises add
to the fear of sudden death that already grips the inmates. The cells are bare and
have been specially designed to dispose of the guilty quickly: their floors can open
independently, plunging the occupants into the fires burning beneath Bentham. Is
someone the PCs know locked in this place?
 Propaganda. The Supervisor constantly carries out campaigns of pure terror against
this floor’s inmates, and spends much of the budget on devising security measures
that can completely shut down a person’s magical powers. Where do most of the
Supervisor’s funds come from? How do they invest these funds?
 The fruits of hatred. Six probes, artfully positioned throughout the floor, keep the
anti-magic field active at all times: anyone under their influence constantly suffers
from the weak status and cannot perform any Rituals. Moreover, each spell costs 5
extra MP for each active probe. How can they be deactivated?
 Escape. If all the probes are deactivated or destroyed, the anti-magic effect instantly
stops. But it won’t be long before the Supervisor and their cronies unleash anti-magus
machines against anyone attempting to escape. Even so, the sixth-floor inmates are
quite happy to collaborate with anyone who proposes a valid escape plan.
b THE SLITHER
The prison is rife with tales of the Slither, a creature believed to dwell in the sea of lava,
who feasts on prisoners, moving easily between the Complex’s hallways and floors.
 Disappearances. No one can confirm the Slither’s existence, but it is a fact that
inmates disappear regularly for unknown reasons. Who was the last to disappear?
What traces did they leave behind?
W
31
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Invisible. The anti-magic field hinders the use of magical arts, but it does not seem
to bother the Slither, who moves about rapidly, unseen by surveillance systems. What
trace did the creature leave behind? How did the PCs discover it?
 All are prisoners. Though they do not talk about it, even the Supervisor is terrified of
the Slither. What measures have they put in place to contain the creature? Perhaps
the Slither was born from the Supervisor’s failed experiments or feeds upon the pain
of the Esper inmates?
 The Bentham horror. The Slither is an invertebrate monster with an erect posture.
It Absorbs fire and dark damage and is covered in magnetic debris that distorts
any attempted scan or reading. It is Vulnerable to ice damage and when in Crisis,
it tries to flee, emitting incandescent flashes. What created it? Why does even the
Supervisor fear it?
? FOR A FRIEND
One of the Player Characters is contacted by a childhood friend, Anastasia. She asks
the group to help her free her brother, Gerard, incarcerated for having tried to stop the
beating of striking workers by a squad of law enforcers.
 Old memories. Anyone who knows Anastasia surely also met Gerard. What memories
do they have of him? Was he hot-headed, a rebel, or someone harmless?
 A sinister man. The lawyer Karl Missach knows how to get the PCs into the Complex.
However, he is a shady type whose help comes at a steep cost… and he does not want
zenit, just favors. What does he want the PCs to do for him in the fortress? What type
of cover story can he provide?
 Divide and control. The Complex is rife with paranoia: some prisoners have been
selected by the Supervisor to surveil the others. What kind of privileged treatment do
these “guardians” have compared to regular inmates?
 The second floor. Gerard is imprisoned under the jurisdiction of the Hyena, a sadistic
jailor chosen by the Supervisor, who gained his moniker from the awful habit of using
bursts of laughter to spread terror. The Hyena is not willing to let Gerard go, and his
goons collaborate with the prison guards to hinder the PCs.
 Wings of freedom. Helping Anastasia, the PCs discover that she is part of a faction of
smugglers, the Otters. In exchange for Gerard’s release, she will thank the PCs by letting
them use her group’s expertise to enter any town or village. What could go wrong?
“The Complex shall be your second chance. Reflect upon your mistakes.
Work for the nation. Comprehend the futility of your betrayal.”

THE CELESTIAL ARK
W
An ancient alien spacecraft crashed long ago in a land of rivers and waterfalls – a
natural landscape with which the ship is now in perfect symbiosis, as though it had
always belonged there. Standing before the Celestial Ark conveys a sense of wonder,
but also unease, for it is constantly patrolled by armed members of the Cult, who
bar entry to all.
Donum Coeoeli
DONUM COELI AT A GLANCE
Keywords: antiquity, sublimity, alien technology.
Terrain: water, forest, space alloys. Common elements: a i E
Travel roll: d8. Rare elements: f a
Dangers: mutated fauna near the spaceship, Cult spies ready to take out any
interlopers.
Discoveries: an ancient object in an unused exit capsule, visions of a peaceful
alien creature, sources of mystical power within the ship.
Themes: extraterrestrial civilizations, cryptoarchaeology, religious
fanaticism, exploitation of relics.
33

2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Celestial Ark should include at least one of these features:
 Alien tech so advanced it seems magical.
 Unexplored or sealed rooms, protected by traps or similar devices.
 A mysterious cult, greedy for knowledge, and unwilling to share.
 A profound, hidden secret with vast existential implications.
» POSITION
It is unlikely that the Player Characters access the Celestial Ark during the initial
phases of the game: the site’s existence and the consequences of the impact on the
surrounding nature should always be shrouded in a thick veil of mystery. Once the
Cult’s activities are discovered, it should be simpler to find a way in and explore the
contaminated area, perhaps through contact with alien creatures or studying data
from previous local populations.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
For a Villain, the knowledge hidden within Donum Coeli is a potential tool of
domination. The Cult or similar organizations, keen to recover that knowledge, might
provide cover and security to those conducting research, at least until the PCs show
up. Controlling the Ark means being able to manipulate the faithful as well as terrorize
enemies – a divine gift, desecrated and made into an instrument of death.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 What are the distinctive features of the alien spaceship’s design?
What features are markedly different from the technology you are used to?
 Who named the ship Donum Coeli, and when? Is this its only name?
 What are the characteristics of the natural environment that engulfed the
ship? Is the site near some more recent settlement?
 What defense mechanisms protect the ship? How can you avoid
them? Are they still functional?
 What may have caused the crash? What immediate effects
did the event have on the place of impact?
 Which other factions covet the Ark?
34
W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Donum Coeli into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich
the story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ SYMBIOSIS
As time passed, the area around the point of impact mutated. After centuries of change,
flora and fauna are now in perfect symbiosis with the ship.
 The waterfall. The ship is surrounded by crystal-clear waterfalls dotted with shining
crystals. The Cult seems to understand the regenerative powers of these waters, but
grants access only to a few selected individuals. How can one become worthy? On
whom has the treatment had an unexpected result?
 Floral corruption. A field of mutated celandines blossom around the point of impact,
but one of the Cult’s core laws forbids anyone from going near the flowers, considering
them soul corruptors. These strange flowers seem to follow the movement of the
stars at night. They are “listening to the song of the cosmos”, as described in some of
the mysterious organization’s forbidden texts, which were deemed heretical.
 The Cult of the Gift. Cult members guard the ship day and night, geared up in neverseen-
before alien tech. They live and sleep in the outer areas of the ship and are
currently led by Azalya (minor Villain), who made the Ark her home. The rooms are
“purified” daily, and access is barred to all. What are the Cult’s dogmas? Why are they so
tied to the Celestial Ark? What dangerous extraterrestrial weapon does Azalya wield?
b THE GIFT OF THE HEAVENS
Donum Coeli’s unexplored halls hide the ship’s secrets. Once beyond the Cult’s guards,
the Player Characters might finally uncover what has been concealed for centuries.
 Genetic information. Deep within the ship is a terraforming nucleus formed by DNA
filaments. None of the ship’s original occupants could use it because it was damaged
by the accident. What caused the crash? What happened to everyone?
 Without a world. If the PCs consult the ship’s black box, they discover that the aliens
were fleeing their home planet. Why? Was it perhaps destroyed by some powerful
entity? Did the crew really want to land on this planet? How long did the ship wander
through space before the impact?
W
35
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Degeneration. Apparently, the damage to the core of the ship caused the spillage of
mutagen liquid that progressively transformed the biome around the impact site. It is
not possible to repair the core without the genetic imprint of one of the aliens – even
just touching it would cause painful cellular degeneration. Where can you find the
alien genetic material?
 Alien or human? In the past, the Cult has tried to destroy the core, failing miserably. The
sole survivor, Leander (major Villain), still wanders the crash site, his DNA recombined
into a deformed but cunning monstrosity who craves freedom. If hindered by the PCs,
he attacks with his four tentacles, each of them Vulnerable to a different damage type
among air, earth, fire, and ice and capable of Absorbing the opposite element.. Besides
continuously stealing Hit Points and Mind Points from the PCs, these fearsome, soldierrank
appendages can protect Leander’s body from attacks. The body itself is Vulnerable
to physical damage but Resistant to all other forms of damage.
 Backlog. After defeating Leander, the group can decipher the Ark’s secret code, which
the Villain has failed to unlock completely. With this information, the PCs should be
able to solve the issues with the core: how can they do so? How will this change the
fate of the planet forever?
? HERESY
Professor Emmet was imprisoned for publicly denouncing the inconsistencies within
the Cult of the Gift before its followers. He is now under custody within the Ark,
awaiting execution for heresy.
 Old allies. Recruited by the professor’s assistant, Mid, the PCs need to infiltrate the ship
and save him. Did they already know the professor and his research? In which previous
adventure was his help invaluable? How is he connected to the Cult?
 The guardian. The Cult’s base is guarded by an ancient alien construct, reprogrammed
to follow the Cult’s orders. ANATHEMA 002 is Resistant to all damage types as long
as it remains powered by the Ark’s central computer. How can the construct be dealt
with, or the connection severed?
 Zenit and gratitude. If the PCs free the professor, they receive a new and
reprogrammed ANATHEMA 002. The construct possesses secret memory banks with
much information about the ship, its crew, and the accident. Moreover, Mid will reward
the group with a nice pile of shiny zenit.
“Beware of the Ark that came from celestial space.
Askew the yellow flowers. Fall prey to their temptations,
and not even the Cult will be able to save your soul.”

THE ROAMING CITY
W
That which would simply appear as a huge excavator from afar, actually hosts an
entire city inside its clanking metal shell – its population constantly busy, working
on the extraction of the planet’s precious resources. As the tracks tear and crush the
ground, the land itself shudders deep within. To survive, Extractor 7 must plunder and
reap – is there really no better way?
Extractor 7
EXTRACTOR 7 AT A GLANCE
Keywords: anthropization, environmentalism, land exploitation.

Dangers: the malfunction or collapse of an entire city sector, looters sabotaging
the extraction process for personal gain.
Discoveries: a secret passage that speeds travel between different areas of the

Themes: the uncontrolled extraction of resources that impoverishes
the land, neo-feudalism within moving cities.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Roaming City should include at least one of these features:
 A working-class population completely dominated and exploited by the system.
 A bright and ambitious individual, who lost sight of their original, noble intentions.
 A resource extraction system with no concern for the environment.
 Politics that cover up labor exploitation.
» POSITION
Extractor 7 is the typical mid-adventure location, where Player Characters dwell upon
the sad consequences of environmental exploitation and on the people doomed to
spend each day frantically working, imprisoned by a system that continuously plunders
resources, time, and lives. Alternatively, the group might start the campaign onboard
the Roaming City or encounter it early on during their travels, coming to understand
the implications of its activities only after a tragic event.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Extractor 7 can be the main source of income for any Villain, who could be part of the
city’s management or some corporation that manipulates things from above. The land
destruction could also be part of a larger plan tied to the planet’s key resource or the
destruction of something especially “unwelcome”. And, once it is no longer useful, the
Extractor could be destroyed by a mere command or press of a button…
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 What territory is currently threatened by the Roaming City? Why are you
particularly connected to it?
 What is the first thing you notice when you see the extraction device?
 How long has this ecomonster been operating? What resources were used
– or wasted – to construct it?
 Which of you has seen a place they loved destroyed by the city?
 Do you know the inhabitants of Extractor 7? Who decides its
routes and paths of destruction?
 How are personnel selected? Which physical or mental
qualities are especially sought after?
38
W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Extractor 7 into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE WORLD OF DOCTOR RYAN
Extractor 7’s Sectors were not designed as parts of a city, though that is what they
became. Anyone born in Extractor 7, dies in Extractor 7.
 The Board of Directors (BoD). The city’s five superintendents report to doctor Albert
Ryan (minor Villain), a Zelnach Company employee who has made Extractor 7 into
his private fief. What are the Board member’s different jurisdictions?
 The subterranean market. Seemingly under the BoD’s control, the market forms
the economic heart of the city, hiding anything you might need beneath manholes
and within snaking corridors. How can the PCs orient themselves in this area? What
deadly risks does it hide?
 The Sectorless. People who lose their jobs tend to flee towards the undercity, a last
resort for those too scared of the outside world to leave Extractor 7. Here, the days
are marked by deprivation and hustling, with little light and much hunger. But some
come here of their own accord: why?
 The Union. One group of people is trying to improve the working conditions of those
who live in the Roaming City. They are the only ones who can bridge the gap between
the BoD and the workers, and because of this, many accuse the Union of being corrupt
and “coincidentally” aligned with doctor Ryan. How does one get a meeting with the
Union? Do any of the PCs know a Union member, or even its leader?
b BELOW THE SURFACE
Discrepancies between production reports and the actual materials delivered are
becoming more common. Where did the missing resources go? Could the legends about
a hidden Sector be true?
 Tau Sector. Word on the street suggests the existence of a phantom Sector. Some
workers and technicians claim they heard voices and the droning of machinery coming
from the ventilation ducts of Sector Sigma – which often malfunction and suffer from
power losses. Are the missing resources being used for some secret project?
W

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Missing workers. In the aftermath of several blackouts, some Sector Sigma workers
have vanished into thin air. Sector chief Douglas’ explanations are unconvincing,
and folks are more scared than ever. Does the chief know more than he lets on?
How can he be convinced to reveal the truth? What would he risk if he spoke out?
 Erik. This young technician fled Sector Tau with proof of the experiments conducted
there. He knows he cannot trust Douglas, nor any Zelnach agents – the tech he was
working on is too dangerous to end up in the hands of businesspeople. What is it?
How can the PCs help?
? FOR A FISTFUL OF ZENIT
Sector chief Marisol contacts the Player Characters to solve a problem tied to a
redistribution and redevelopment scheme proposed by Human Resources, which could
cause the pointless loss of many lives.
 Top-down decisions. Ross, Head of Human Resources and BoD member, has suddenly
decided that Sector Omega is no longer economically viable – it will be shut down
and replaced with warehouses.
 A bad way to go. If the characters do not intervene, Sector Omega’s inhabitants will be
rounded up and kicked out of Extractor 7, which will likely condemn them to a horrible
death. What fate awaits them in the wastes around the city? What lurks there?
 Alone against all. Signs of impoverishment and rust are everywhere in Extractor
7, but Sector Omega seems even more run down than other areas of the city. What
makes its state of decay immediately visible? What caused its decline?
 Countermove. Analyzing Sector Omega’s balance sheets, Marisol discovered that it
would be possible to redevelop the area and save it from being shut down. However,
she needs the PCs to protect the people from Ross until she can prepare a full plan for
the BoD. How can the group sabotage Ross’ plans and save Sector Omega?
 Grateful. If the PCs help Marisol save Sector Omega, they are rewarded with free
access to the area’s labs and workshops, where they can improve their equipment and
start new Projects at a discount.
The Extractor and its people are desperate: they seem ready
to do anything just to survive a few more hours.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Alien Mothership should include at least one of these features:
 Especially advanced weapons for attacking the protagonists’ planet.
 A cutting-edge system providing cloaking and defense
 An unknown technology for moving through time and space.
 An alien bloodline – perhaps near extinct? – with unfathomable motivations.
» POSITION
The Nautiloss could be a turning point for the campaign and the location of the
narrative’s first and false ending. Whether they arrived on the ship by force or their
own free will, the Player Characters could find a way to stop the invasion and save
the planet’s population. However, some revelations might challenge the legitimacy
of their actions.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
Whoever controls the ship – ideally the creators of the robots attacking the planet –
may have valid reasons to behave as they do, though they may still appear as a major
Villain to the protagonists. However, the Player Character’s actions could usher in a
new Villain, more dangerous and powerful than the last: perhaps a creature hidden
within the Nautiloss or an inhabitant of the planet, fallen prey to obsession and
convinced that the only way to save their kind is by exterminating the alien species.
The PCs may have a difficult choice to make…
 What are the main features of the alien robots? How do they pursue their
work of destruction?
 How did the ship breach the planet’s defenses? Is it equipped with some
form of cloaking device?
 How did you reach the ship? Were you helped by a specific organization or
kidnapped during a raid?
 Where do they keep the imprisoned population?
 What kind of treatment do the ship’s “guests” receive?
 What strange rumors have the humans heard about the
‘aliens’ plans? Is there any proof?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Nautiloss into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE NIGHTMARE WITHIN
Where there seems to be life, nothing is actually real. Instead, Nautiloss’ most populous
area appears to host a barren and inhuman tomorrow.
 The womb. Within the icy bowels of the ship, the prisoners brought to the Nautiloss
are sorted in rows of metallic cells. Who or what takes care of them? Does one of the
PCs recognize a familiar face here?
 The armory. New robots are constantly manufactured and armed for the invasion
– they await deployment behind vast walls of purplish metal. What energy source
powers the robots? How can the process be stopped?
 The Reaver. One of the production lines is heavily guarded by armored robots and
electromagnetic fields. If they can gain access, the PCs can discover the Reaver, the
unfinished prototype of a multifunctional transport and combat robot. Some of its
physical traits are eerily similar to those of the inhabitants of the invaded planet.
What are the aliens really planning? What is the prototype’s purpose?
 The charging cells. This place is dimly lit by automatic lights, and heavy with an
ominous silence. The robots that survived combat come here for repairs: they coil
their long arms and crouch into specially designed cubicles. It is unclear who is in
charge of it all – the only living souls on the ship seem to be the prisoners. Where are
the aliens hiding? How do the robots behave if disturbed during their “rest”?
b WHAT REMAINS
Exploring the ship, the Player Characters find a damaged robot. By following it, they can
enter a private area which houses a multitude of deactivated robots: a great opportunity
to safely examine them.
 The chip. Upon inspection, the PCs discover a special chip that tracks and identifies
the robots: it broadcasts information to a control unit deep within the ship. Who or
what examines the logs?
W
43
W

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 A life in a link. Deciphering the chip’s contents, the heroes can discover the
“Thoriath” code. This is the name of the alien species who created the ship and
robots: on the verge of extinction, these aliens transferred their consciousnesses
into the Nautiloss’ systems – it was the only way to stay “alive”. Can the prisoners
save the aliens from extinction?
 The bridge. The last flesh and blood Thoriath survivor, Verlon (major Villain), is
holed up among the bridge’s empty stations and can be reached by decoding the
chip. If threatened, he controls robots at a distance and uses Esper-like powers (see
page 110) to defend himself. When defeated, he explains that he traveled from the
future to save his people from extermination at the hands of the planet’s inhabitants.
But is destroying lives to save others truly the solution? Is someone or something
manipulating Verlon? How can you break through his convictions?
? CYNTHIA
A group of humans is discovered and captured while trying to escape the ship. An
utterly terrorized woman named Cynthia manages to get away and contacts the Player
Characters: she needs help to save her companions.
 She seems… suspicious. If the PCs meet her outside the ship, Cynthia seems a bit
too eager to lead them inside and does not initially reveal her motivations. If met
onboard the ship, Cynthia is more direct, as her companions are nearby. What makes
the PCs inclined to trust her? Is it all real, or is it just a subtle alien ploy?
 A new world. Cynthia’s companions are alive. She is certain because she overheard
some alien communications discussing the prisoners’ “reconversion” project. She does
not know when this might take place, but she can provide the PCs with a recording of
the conversation and lead them to the place where the escape plan failed. Why would
the aliens use humans to create new models?
 The rescue. Cyntia’s companions were indeed transferred to a special holding cell to
await the terrible “procedure”. How will they be converted into alien robots? Will their
consciousnesses remain intact or be replaced? If the prisoners are saved, Cynthia
rewards the PCs with an interactive map stolen from the Nautiloss: it can track the
movement of the robots… and of some other, unidentified, life forms!
“All we have is the Void you will one day leave us with. Today, history
is rewritten: you shall know Void, and your All shall be ours.”

THE MILITARY LAB
W
Far from prying eyes, Nidavellir is surrounded by glaciers on an almost forgotten planet.
In this military outpost, concealed by massive steel walls and thick reinforced doors,
scientists carry out perverted experiments in the utmost secrecy. It is an impenetrable
research base where morals and ethics are lost within a labyrinth of aseptic corridors lit
only by dim, intermittent neon lights.
Nidavellir
NIDAVELLIR AT A GLANCE
Keywords: immorality, mutation, progress, top secret.
Terrain: glacier, hangar, lab. Common elements: b i
Travel roll: d8, d10. Rare elements: f b
Dangers: the outpost’s automatic alarm system, capable of picking up on intruding
heat traces; a dangerous specimen who escaped the lab.
Discoveries: a scientist repenting from his crimes, a serum that fortifies the
body, an unguarded console with the lab’s schematics.
Themes: captive specimens, dehumanization, illegal and ruthless
experimentation.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Military Lab should include at least one of these features:
 A secret plan for a weapon with high military potential.
 The grotesque results of unhinged experimentation.
 An amoral competition to reach the pinnacle of evolution and progress.
 A captive alien species, used to enhance research.
» POSITION
Locations like Nidavellir conceal an important secret that can drastically change the
direction of a campaign, dragging the Player Characters into a desperate race against
time to prevent a dangerous project from falling into the wrong hands. However,
information about the lab’s location should not be public domain: this is why the PCs will
likely encounter this location only in the game’s later phases, after some investigation.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
The lab is an excellent base of operations for any major Villain worthy of their name,
though they are unlikely to be there in person. They probably prefer to scheme from
afar using a false identity, leaving minor Villains to manage the lab and pursue their
evil plans. However, if the heroes try to thwart their schemes, this might also be the
location where the showdown with the major Villain takes place, perhaps after they
have escalated into a supreme form.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 What cruel experiments are secretly conducted in the lab? For what purpose?
Have any of you taken part in, or are otherwise connected to the experiments?
 Who leads the projects? Who are their subordinates, and why did they agree
to take part in the experiments?
 The planet is cold and inhospitable, but is it truly uninhabited?
Who lives in this location besides the scientists?
 Which factions fight over the tech guarded in the lab?
 Who within the many research teams has links to the PCs’ past?
 Who are the ones being experimented upon? How are
they selected? How are they connected to the PCs?

STORY HOOKS
When bringing Nidavellir into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ SECTOR EXIA 1-0
Deep within the bowels of the earth, this area houses the results of incomplete
research and failed experiments, hidden far from prying eyes.
 Experimental cells. A long hallway lit by intermittent neon lights. On each side,
dozens of containment capsules are separated by thick steel bars. Within them are
monsters deprived of humanity. What traits do they share?
 The research hub. The tapping of keyboards fills the air, while gaunt, worn faces stare
into bright screens. It goes on forever. The scientists are driven to complete their
projects by a sadistic and smoldering rivalry, and politics that allow no mistakes. What
are they working on? What punishment awaits if they fail?
 Experiment α. A creature born from the union of ancestral cells and complex
nanobots lies dormant in Sector Exia 1-0. For years, it has been the unwilling victim
of countless experiments – its heart is now filled with rage and vengeance. If fought,
this champion-rank adversary marks each creature it hits, dealing extra damage. The
nanobots keep it in a constant, tumultuous state of shapeshifting, granting a wide
range of attacks and healing its most severe wounds: as long as it is in Crisis, this
creature recovers 5 Hit Points and recovers from one status effect – if present – at
the end of each round. It is Immune to poison damage, Resists ice and dark, and is
Vulnerable to light and bolt damage.
b RECYCLING
Many ambitious minds have left their homes and traveled to Nidavellir. Unfortunately,
none may return.
 The army of the icefields. A cold and unwelcoming wasteland surrounds the lab,
extending as far as the eye can see. No living organism should be able to survive on
the planet’s surface, and yet, some creatures restlessly roam the icefields. Their bodies
are maimed and mutated, covered only by worn rags. Are they aggressive?
W
47
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 The origins of horror. If the PCs follow the trail left by the wandering mutants, they
find a secret entrance to an old wing of the lab. There, a surgical bed surrounded by
mechanized arms can recombine different genomes to create new species or modify
existing ones. Where do its test subjects come from? Does Nidavellir’s management
know about this?
 Genius among geniuses. Dr. Evyus is a brilliant scientist, though utterly devoid of
morals. He is ready to make any sacrifice for progress and seems to feel no guilt for
his actions, to the point that even the Directorate deemed his proposals “unseemly”.
If challenged openly, Dr. Evyus is a minor Villain who throws chemicals and small
explosives, inflicting the dazed status effect. He is Immune to ice damage and
Vulnerable to fire, bolt, and poison damage. He also carries a serum that transforms
him into a feral mutant: upon entering Crisis, he injects the serum, gaining Resistance
to physical damage in addition to new abilities.
? INFORMATION LEAK
The Player Characters are contacted by Adam, a well-known scientist in Nidavellir’s
galaxy. A few days ago, he lost contact with Elya, a former colleague, who had left for
the lab some time prior. She had been in touch with Adam before disappearing and
was ready to reveal secret information.
 Experiment 262. Rumor has it that in Nidavellir, the scientists are trying to implant
a new type of cell within a specific host body, but up to now, the consequences of the
failed experiments have been cruel and irreversible. What cells are involved? What
are the consequences of cellular rejection? What is the project’s ultimate goal?
 Information leak. Communication with the outside world is forbidden, but that did not
stop Elya, who was unfortunately caught red-handed. Adam fears she will undergo a
terrifying process known as reset, an experimental procedure that deprives a person
of their humanity and memories. Can the PCs save Elya before it is too late?
 Countdown. Should the PCs save Elya or the information she stole, one of the
scientists will lock down the wing that they are in and activate a self-destruct
mechanism. Escaping requires a 10-section Clock, and the group must manage to fill
it within a total of 5 Checks. Otherwise, they are reduced to 0 HP – they may Surrender
or Sacrifice as usual.
Progress is priceless, and the end justifies the means.
Keep pace with evolution, or be crushed. There’s no other way.

THE CORPORATE CITY
W
Septentrion rises on a massive asteroid at the edge of Gerion’s Belt, a triangle of
systems rich in resources but now devastated by the conflict between the Federation
and independentist guerrillas. Designed to be the ideal city-factory, Septentrion is
governed by the three companies that form the League of Patriots, a conservative and
technocratic faction with great influence within the Federal Assembly.
Septentrion
SEPTENTRION AT A GLANCE
Keywords: manipulation, rebellion, exploitation.
Terrain: elevators, hallways, platforms. Common elements: b b
Travel roll: d10, d12. Rare elements: a l
Dangers: a police patrol on the lookout for anti-corporate activists, a cloud of
noxious exhaust smoke, an out-of-control mutated worker.
Discoveries: a group of Gerionite saboteurs, an unprotected weapon shipment,
a bar owner who helps wanted folks hide and flee.
Themes: human life reduced to mere resources, absolute devotion
to profit, the hypocrisy of the upper class.
49

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Corporate City should include at least one of these features:
 A corrupt, incompetent, and unstable administrative council.
 Relentless propaganda that fuels and exploits the insecurity of the citizens.
 A strong gap between social classes, masked as a meritocracy.
 An armed police force serving corporate interests.
» POSITION
Locations like Septentrion are often a starting point, though they are anything but a
safe and secure refuge. The campaign’s first arc will often focus on fighting the local
corporations and overthrowing or capturing those in power. Doing so might turn the
city into the PCs’ base of operations, though it usually also reveals that they have only
dealt with a minor manifestation of a much, much greater threat.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
This type of location is initially controlled by one or more Villains – usually minor;
though their greed may be extreme, they lack the vision and personality for more
significant roles. Later on during the campaign, the city will likely need to defend
against a major or supreme Villain who plans to “bring back order, once and for all”
using violence and repression.
CHAPTER
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Which of you has visited Septentrion in the past? Why?
 Who leads Septentrion’s Administrative Council? How is this institution tied to
the League of Patriots? Why is it quietly supported by the Federation?
 Which old acquaintance of the PCs might be in Septentrion?
 Who founded Septentrion? How did their worldviews aid the League of
Patriot’s radical position?
 What was Septentrion known for before the League’s rise to power?
What was the city-factory’s original purpose? How have its
activities contributed to destabilizing Gerion’s Belt?
 Which PC comes from, or has lived in, Gerion’s Belt?

W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Septentrion into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich
the story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ THE OUTER CITADEL
Built during the past ten years, these neighborhoods rise on the outward-facing side of a
chasm on the asteroid’s surface, directly above the original industrial plant.
 Triskel Plaza. Besides competing over profit and federal funds, Septentrion’s
corporations also compete over the view: their skyscrapers are constantly growing.
Aurumcore once handled mineral extraction on the asteroid but now focuses its
attention on the moons abandoned by refugees fleeing the Gerion War. Halleni is
Septentrion’s original metalworking company, now led by the founder’s heir. Last to
the scene, but still important and influential, Courier has aggressively monopolized
logistics, urban management, and security.
 The Council Palace. This is where the companies publicly meet the press and the
workers’ representatives. Which journalist recently incurred the Council’s ire? What
incident are they investigating, and how were they threatened?
 Residential ring. The families of managers and white-collar employees live in the
citadel’s outskirts. Parks, shops, and bars are scattered between rows of small houses
and tower blocks. Everywhere, flashing neon signs praise productive life and business
mentality. Which of the PCs’ contacts lives here?
 Halleni Hospital. A vast complex with cutting-edge magical surgical equipment.
Citizens with standard or elite company insurance have free access to treatment
for themselves and their families, while apprenticeship packages cover a single
individual and provide only a limited number of treatments per year, from a restricted
list. Which procedures are not covered? How does this policy let Halleni control the
population’s private lives?
 The undercity. A pair of elevators guarded by bipedal military walkers lead to
Septentrion’s old neighborhoods: a housing labyrinth once belonging to the miner
families but now rented by blue-collar workers, basic employees, and Gerionite
refugees. Smog saturates the air, and the solar lamps exude radiation. Since prices
are based on surface income, the “people below” often have more than one job and
do not see the stars for weeks or months. Who or what could cause these people to
unite? What happened last time they rebelled?
W
51
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
b THINGS DO NOT ADD UP
Septentrion’s data clearly show that the city should not have enough energy and space
to sustain the great population influx.
 Investigation. Further information is counted as industrial secrets under the Federal
Code, and is encrypted. Do the PCs know a hacker who can help them? What do they
want in exchange for their help or silence?
 Human resources. The secret concerns the ruthless exploitation of Septentrion’s
main resource: the influx of people seeking fortune, or fleeing the war. Death rates
in the asteroid’s inner neighborhoods are high, and federal law calls for the quick
disposal of bodies in any space settlement. So the poorest of the population become
literal fuel: their spirits are forever torn from the stream of souls and absorbed by
the Elysium Reactor, and their memory patterns are stored in federal databases.
Who planned this system? How does it affect magic? Why was the importance of the
stream of souls forgotten?
 Perverse balance. Septentrion’s leadership must maintain the city’s image as a
rich land of opportunity, while also ensuring high death rates. Who denounced this
hypocrisy and how were they silenced?
? THE CITY HUNGERS, THE CITY FORGETS
Andrea Laskin, a young Gerionite activist, contacts the PCs while they are working
in the undercity. His mother Valeria disappeared some days ago and the police are
ignoring the case.
 Corruption. Why are the police not investigating? Is it payback for Andrea’s role in the
anti-Federation protests? Who among the force wants to look into the case, and how
are their colleagues planning to “take care of them”?
 No escape. Hit by a mass layoff and fearing she could never pay for her son’s
schooling, Valeria joined an experimental study that includes excellent corporate
benefits. However, the offer is generous because doctor Alston (minor Villain) does
not intend for the test subjects to survive: the goal is testing the body’s resistance to
radiation from Gerion’s moons. Which company financed the projects? How did they
obtain the Federation’s approval and protection?
 Trust. If the PCs interrupt the experiment and save Valeria, Andrea will put them in
touch with local rebel cells.
“Others may not care, but here in Septentrion, we defend the foundational
values of the Federation: loyalty, family, ingenuity, and merit! Men and women,
Federate or Gerionite: all are welcome if they are ready to roll up their sleeves!”

HEART OF THE NETWORK
W
At first sight, the Heart of the Network can resemble a kaleidoscopic glass room where
voices, steps, and thoughts echo infinitely. Its shape and size are unfathomable and
unmeasurable: the Soul Nexus changes based on the will of its user, and anyone without
a trained mind can be lost forever within the sea of data, becoming just another ghost
wandering the waves of an infinite Network…

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TYPICAL FEATURES
The typical Heart of the Network should include at least one of these features:
 A hacker who abandoned their corporal form to live a purely digital life.
 The echo of a legendary Arcanum who does not exist outside of the network.
 A blurred horizon of code that makes it impossible to tell earth from sky.
 A breach that can lead to any place.
» POSITION
A location such as the Soul Nexus can appear many times during a techno fantasy
campaign, even starting from the prologue or initial flashback. Perhaps one of the
Player Characters was even created there. Towards the end of the adventure, the
Heart of the Network should be freely visitable, the characters now conscious of what
they search for and the dangers hidden within this vast, mysterious place.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
The unlimited vastness of the Soul Nexus makes it a flexible location for any Villain’s
plans, whether it is a hiding place or secret base of operations from which they can
search for lost Arcana or plan the takeover of the entire soul network. Also, what better
place to erase confidential information or cover up nefarious plans? After all, all one
needs is a click or a quick rewrite of part of the code… and even the Player Characters
are likely to miss the lurking traps.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Which of you has already entered the Soul Nexus? How did you get out?
 What is the safest way to access the Core of the Network? Who or what
protects it?
 Who dreamed about reaching the Core of the Network? Why?
 What dreadful threat is concealed here? Why is it so fearsome, and why
should it remain confined?
 What is the best way to avoid losing oneself within this immense
agglomerate of data with no apparent sense of direction?
 Some say a powerful Arcanum was created in this place.
What is it? Who made it?
54
W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Soul Nexus into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich
the story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ ARPACITY
Ancient buildings resembling skyscrapers surround a great plaza at the center of a city
of sorts, which is visible from everywhere in the network.
 Odd phantoms. Though it may seem empty, the city is inhabited by two-dimensional
humanoid beings with rows of difficult-to-interpret data on their “torsos”. Perhaps a
Ritual could help communicate with them, but what crucial component is missing?
Where can it be found?
 Nem3s1s. If the Ritual is successful, a force field activates, trapping the PCs in the
city and awakening the Nem3s1s security protocol. This minor Villain has the shape
of an angelic woman with data wings – she sees the PCs as intruders and attacks
on sight. The group should decide if they want to fight, or escape the barrier with
another Ritual or by spending a Fabula Point. In combat, Nem3s1s summons two
random soldier-rank creatures from other dimensions as helpers, and heals them
with the Justice spell when needed. Using the Nemesis Mark and Command, she can
mark a PC and then force them to follow her orders. She is Vulnerable to ice and dark
damage, Resistant to earth, and Absorbs light damage.
 Hidden files. After defeating Nem3s1s, the force field vanishes, and the PCs can
access a hidden space below the skyscrapers where they find a secret code. What
does it contain?
b THE THREE FATES
Some believe the Soul Nexus to be home to a threefold artificial intelligence with vast
knowledge of the Continuum’s mysteries. Its parts are named Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos.
 System bug. The Fates can appear when they want, manifesting in a space that
glitches and transforms every few minutes. How do these glitches form, and how does
the space look when the characters reach it?
W
55
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
 Trial of the Continuum. The PCs can bind Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos as a single
Arcanum after passing a different challenge for each of the Fates. For example, the
PCs might need to confront their Themes and Identity with the domains of each
Sister (see below) or fight once more the digital spirit of a past enemy, which will
challenge the group’s Bonds.
 The binding. If the three Fates grant their favor, they condense into the Arcanum of
the Weave, whose domains are necessity, truth, and life. Their merge effect increases
Willpower by one die size, and they have three dismiss options: Clotho restores 30 HP
and MP to all PCs and their allies; Lachesis makes one enemy lose 30 MP and inflicts
three status effects chosen from dazed, weak, slow and shaken, and Atropos lets the
user perform an immediate Study action whose Result is tripled.
? ANIMA AND ANIMUS
Part of the Soul Nexus’ consciousness directly contacts the PCs with a special request:
to reunite the two severed halves of the soul network.
 Fragmentation. One half calls himself Animus and plans to reprogram the entire Soul
Nexus. The other half, Anima, contacted the PCs to stop Animus and restore the soul
network’s integrity.
 System error. Hidden in a forest of data, Animus unleashes demons upon the
intruding PCs. These creatures Absorb bolt damage and when they hit an opponent,
they also rewrite a part of their memories, inflicting shaken. The affected character
must then share a memory tied to their Theme, Identity, Origin, or a Bond, and loses
the ability to invoke that element until they recover from shaken.
 Anima vs Animus. Animus cannot fight without his demons. If the PCs reach him,
Animus explains that all he wants is to affirm himself as a living being, since the
fragmentation has taken place and he now exists, regardless of what Anima desires.
The protagonists can decide to make Animus cease all functions and transfer his
powers to Anima, make the two new beings coexist, or drastically shut down the Soul
Nexus itself. How will this choice change the Core of the Network forever?
 A new life. Regardless of what the PCs decide, the artifact that caused the
fragmentation appears before them: it is the soulrend (see Core Rulebook, page
290), a blade that can sever consciousness from the stream of souls. But who was
crazy enough to use the blade on the soul network, changing the Soul Nexus forever?
“One usually cannot give their dreams physical form.
Yet within the Soul Nexus, a true hacker can do anything.”

The typical Field of Wreckage should include at least one of these features:
 Debris and wrecked machinery, transport vehicles, and abandoned constructs.
 Harsh, hostile, and unwelcoming environmental conditions.
 Traces of a now-lost, ancient society.
 A criminal gang of scavengers on the payroll of the government agency in charge.
» POSITION
Vragarath is an ideal place of passage where the group can gain important information,
components, or even artifacts, before continuing their quest. You can place it in any
part of the adventure, though it works best for scenes tied to the lost civilization or
the organizations behind the scavengers.
» THE VILLAINS’ PLANS
This kind of location can interest many Villains, both for its strategic location, which
can provide an ideal, well-hidden lair, and for the resources and knowledge extracted
from the wrecks and the local legends. However, figures well known to the Player
Characters may hide behind the scavengers’ activities. Perhaps the protagonists could
investigate further and uncover the shady plans.
POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP
 Who finances the wreck hunters? What greedy purpose do they pursue?
 What led you here? Are you searching for a lost friend or did you follow a
star map in search of local legends?
 Was one of you born on this planet, or have you been here before?
 Who are the descendants of the people from the legends? Why are there
so few survivors?
 How do the locals shelter from the many storms? Why are they
so dangerous?
 How can you travel the wasteland? What kinds of wrecks
clutter it?
58
W
STORY HOOKS
When bringing Vragarath into play, the GM may use the following points to enrich the
story by introducing artifacts, Villains, discoveries, and rewards.
$ LAIR OF THE OMEGAS
The Omegas pursue their illegal affairs from inside the hulk of a giant ship made with
unknown tech. There, they buy and sell objects recovered from the wasteland.
 The hulk. The imposing hulk of the Seath stands out at the field’s center. Within, the
Omegas plan shipments of components scrounged from all Vragarath, progressively
stripping the land of resources and exhausting the local population who have been
forced to work for pennies. How are the Omegas organized? How do they keep the
people in check?
 The exchange hub. From a raised platform on the ship, a dealer auctions off recovered
objects and powerful artifacts. In the alcove below, greedy merchants from everywhere in
the galaxy bid on the pieces. What are the most sought-after items? Which organization
secretly finances the auction?
 The lodgings. What was once the Seath’s crew quarters now houses a large shared area
where the Omegas rest and hold long-distance meetings with their mysterious patrons.
Of course, the access is well guarded by fierce droid mastiffs, and only those who have a
special magnetic key can enter.
 The chest. This chest is hidden in the lodging area and can be forced open only by entering
the soul network and finding its owner’s source code. Who does the chest belong to? What
does it contain? Which PC knows how to evade its identification system?
b ANOTHER VRAGARATH
In some areas of the wasteland, traces of Vragarath’s ancient civilization are carved

to a priceless power…
 Vrath canyon. While exploring the ruins, the PCs discover strange symbols all leading
in the same direction. Some descendants of the planet’s natives hide among the
scavengers to guard the markings’ secrets. If the group earns their trust, they reveal
the planet’s true history (see below) and guide the heroes to a mysterious monolith
hidden in a canyon between ancient, destroyed vessels.

CHAPTER
 Vrath’s history. Long ago, the Vrathyan were a peaceful and technologically advanced
people who lived on the planet Vrath. Trying to keep the peace with its neighboring
nations, who were always at war and guided by expansionist desires, the Vrathyan
were gradually forced into surrendering the planet’s limited resources. Eventually,
Vrath’s energy dwindled: the cities fell into ruin, the ships stopped working, and
the Vrathyan civilization fell to colonization. Ruthless criminal organizations took
control of the land, financed by foreign powers who wished to exploit every ounce of
technology that remained on the planet.
 Shadows from the past. The descendants of the Vrathyan are forced to survive by
selling scraps and serving the neighboring nations, who have now claimed large
swathes of the planet and exploit it to satisfy their greed. However, the monolith is
the key to an ancient secret, and the PCs may well support the ancient people in their
fight for retribution. But they are not the first to reach the sacred location: a callous
hitman, Garman (minor Villain), lies in ambush. What are his plans?
? ECHOES IN THE NIGHT
When suddenly struck by a storm, the Player Characters are aided by a mysterious
voice that guides them to an improvised shelter near a giant mecha.
 The lone explorer. Echo is an elderly collector known throughout Vragarath as a sort
of human compass. She is eccentric and reckless, and has deep knowledge of the
fields, including the many legends about treasures that would tempt the greediest
of scavengers. With time and experience, Echo learned to use her voice to guide her
through the storms, which is how she led the PCs to her. Does someone in the group
know her or has heard about her abilities?
 An eight-legged problem. Downed by a – quite suspicious! – mechanical failure on
her mecha, Echo was forced to land near a nest of Zoth: mutant spiders very sensitive
to movements. One false move could wake them all… and they are quite territorial!
What is the weak spot of these creatures? Is there a way to rescue the explorer
without awakening the nest?
 Vragarath’s secrets. If the PCs help Echo, she rewards them with useful intel on
Vragarath, and treasures from its depths. She also warns them about the ruthless
local mob lords, who will do anything to keep the planet’s resources to themselves
and hold onto power.
“Who cares where this stuff came from and whose it was!
You just keep paying the Omegas, and don’t worry about the rest.”

The next pages provide suggestions to help you build techno fantasy conflicts. They
explore these situations from a rules perspective – which the Core Rulebook also
discusses at length from page 58 – but, more importantly, they focus on the narrative
tensions at play during clashes between individuals or factions.
POWER DYNAMICS AND OPPRESSION
At the core of techno fantasy conflicts are dynamics in which one side wields a
crushing power over the other and can influence, manipulate, and reap profits from
its privileged position.
It all starts with the power of the few over the many and the desire of those few gain
even more power: they will not stop until they transcend humanity itself.
When creating situations based on these dynamics, you should pay attention to:
 Who gains from it. It is not necessarily the same people who appear publicly as
power holders; the most cunning antagonists benefit from the conflict without taking
part in it directly.
 Its most obvious manifestations. In true JRPG style, oppression should also be
presented in tangible ways: ever-present surveillance drones, cities divided into
levels with the privileged classes at the top, military patrols on the streets, or
massive Federation spaceships orbiting the planet.
 Its subtle manifestations. The Villains have often already created a solid base for
their plans: they did so through media manipulation, negationism, and militaristic
propaganda, as well as the privatization of education, healthcare, and primary
resources, the profiling of potential dissidents and minorities, and the infiltration and
corruption of political parties and unions.
 Connections to the Player Characters. The various factions involved should connect
to the PCs’ past or at least have had an impact on their lives. Perhaps a Player
Character was once fired for trying to organize a union, survived imperial purges
was the discarded product of a corporate lab, or even a former starfleet officer
dishonorably discharged for denouncing a superior’s corruption.
 Those who rebel. If the Players know who is trying to fight back it makes the
world richer, offers them hooks and options to act upon, and also introduces the
possibility of receiving unexpected help should things take a turn for the worst –
such as after Surrendering.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» ISSUES OF TRUST
A specific characteristic of techno fantasy conflicts is that they are situated within
a society based on lack of trust, where everyone – for survival or because of their
beliefs – sees everyone else as a danger, or at least a competitor. This is what prevents
the various disenfranchised groups from joining together against the system.
Villains embrace and encourage this situation: they know that in a society based
on exhausting and continuous competition, those who already have privileges and
resources will continue to dominate, and be praised for doing so. On the other hand,
the Player Characters are called upon to embody hope in a world that can learn once
again to trust in the good heart of its people.
» TOWARDS UTTER CRUELTY
Techno fantasy’s major and supreme Villains do not just take advantage of their
privileged position, they dream of surpassing the very limits of humanity, believe they
deserve absolute power, and see people as tools or resources. Anyone, including their
family, friends, and closest allies, can be sacrificed to their obsessive vision: as the
Player Characters gradually paint them into a corner, these antagonists will show that
they can perform acts of inhuman cruelty with utter poise.
» WHAT ABOUT FANTASY?
You might wonder how Fabula Ultima’s fantastical elements can survive amid the
grim tones of these conflicts, especially in stories with close real-world echoes. Truth
be told, that is an excellent question. The answer is twofold:
 Magic. The world is still full of magic, the protagonists have extraordinary powers,
and the stream of souls still plays a central role – even becoming a tangible
representation of suffering people around the world and offering an exceptional
chance for revolution and hope.
 Heroic destiny. The protagonists truly have the power to change things radically,
following a heroic path of rebellion and emancipation that will lead them to face, and
take down, the most powerful and ruthless antagonists.
62
W
LAW AND JUSTICE
The tension between law and justice is a typical element of techno fantasy campaigns.
Usually, the premise is as follows:
 The law serves power. The norms and regulations that shape society are almost
entirely in the hands of the privileged classes and Villains easily reshape them to
serve their interests. Even police and surveillance forces, as well as the penitentiary
system are expressions of this form of control: anyone who challenged the status quo
has already been expelled or eliminated.
 Justice is complex. Though widely shared, the idea that everyone should get what
they deserve has many contradictory interpretations. For most, justice is a matter
of merit and punishment; but this vision allows Villains to further divide society
by painting their allies as laudable or their enemies as deplorable, encouraging
aggressive feelings that they can manipulate to stay in control and gain consensus.
Conversely, the Player Characters understand that to create a truly just world in which
life has value regardless of merit and efficiency, society needs to be restructured
drastically. In line with Fabula Ultima’s optimistic tone, they are destined to do just
that, at least in part, but the journey will not be without sacrifice.
Clearly, the Player Characters’ and NPCs’ ideas about law and justice are a part of
how they view the world and its inhabitants. These elements should connect to the
protagonists’ Themes and should be faced head-on during the campaign, culminating
in a memorable clash between different ways of understanding humanity, its destiny,
and what is truly best for it.
For example, the campaign could start with the PCs breaking out of a Star Federation
prison, continue with sabotage and rebellion missions, and end with a fight against a
supreme Villain who plans to use alien machinery to “reform the minds and souls of
the people, creating a safe, orderly galaxy”.
Often, these topics will strike very personal chords and push the Players and Game
Master to evaluate what is happening to the characters and perhaps challenge their
own concept of justice. The best idea is to decide how much you want to explore
these themes before you start playing; afterward, do not hesitate to adjust the game’s
intensity during play or pause it to discuss the direction it is taking.

CHAPTER
SOMETHING OPPRESSIVE AND DYSTOPIAN
In a techno fantasy context, each scene containing tension or conflict should include
an element that enhances the oppressive and dystopian nature of the setting or
represents the cost of the Player Characters’ failure.
Here are some examples:
A giant screen showing a countdown to the activation of a colossal spiritual cannon
pointed at the rebel planet.
The federal army’s soldiers are volunteers, but most are forced into service to ensure
access to medical care and education for themselves and their loved ones.
Swarms of hissing drones observe the movement of civilians; analysts from cultural
surveillance watch the feed in real time and ensure no one shows attitudes or habits
that diverge from the Hierophant’s dogma.
Private military cyborgs were created by installing magical algorithms in the corpses
of the employees who gave the company complete use over their organs in exchange
for stable health insurance.
A battle takes place under the eyes of a statue representing the founder of the
factory-city; her golden head rises tall over the upper neighborhoods, while her
feet reach the slums. Within the folds of her tunic lies a settlement inhabited by the
workers who were fired for having low hourly production rates.
Psychic demons created by the fear and suffering of the population roam the streets
of a megacity devastated by a magical device.
The inmates from the republican prisons are summarily sent to the factories in the
Outer Belt, where they endure grueling work hours to produce weaponry for the
army. They will only be freed if they reach an impossibly high and ever-increasing
production quota.
“The Corps are like water: they always follow the path
of least resistance. And that’s how you reach rock bottom.”
64
W
HIGH TENSION
Conflict situations in techno fantasy campaigns should be frantic and engaging:
characters are often given an all-or-nothing deal, and failure can turn an already
critical situation into a true catastrophe.
Techno fantasy heroes have next to no room for mistakes.
Below, you will find some tips on how to deal with the most common situations!
» INFILTRATION AND SABOTAGE
If the group needs to sneak into a closely guarded location to sabotage something
or free prisoners, it is best to use two Clocks: one for reaching the goal, and one for
the rising level of alertness – should it be filled completely, a fight or a chase will
likely ensue. And finally, the group will no doubt be forced to deal with a boss to
accomplish their mission!
» CHASES
You should play out chases in detail only if all parties travel at comparable speeds.
For example, if the group uses their spaceship to flee a planet that only has land
vehicles, they can leave without hindrance. That being said, the rush to reach the ship
could be an excellent opportunity to use a Clock or play out a conflict.
» CLASHES WITH VEHICLES AND MECHA
Techno fantasy battles often include military vehicles, spaceships, mecha, and
colossal robots. Usually, you should treat vehicles as the stage for your battles,
using Clocks to manage the fight and designing construct-Species NPC profiles
to represent enemy machines and weaponry: remember these will still follow all
normal creature rules, including the option to heal or damage them using Skills,
spells, and potions – remember that, in Fabula Ultima, magic influences matter
on an atomic level. Sci-fi concepts like nanobots can provide excellent narrative
explanations, if required.
That being said, the following pages contain optional rules designed to enhance
campaigns focused on Pilots (see page 158) or that frequently feature combat
between vehicles.
W
65
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
VEHICLE-SCALE BATTLES
The following optional rules provide greater mechanical depth to battles involving
transports and/or creatures whose size is close to that of a vehicle.
» THREE SIZES
Creatures and transports are divided into three broad sizes:
 Small size includes individual characters and the majority of creatures, as well as Pilots
(see page 158) driving vehicles with an Exoskeleton frame (see page 165).
 Medium size includes the majority of land vehicles, boats, armored tanks, military jets
and starfighters, as well as Pilots driving Steeds or Mecha (see page 165; note that the
vehicle’s other passengers are still treated as being small size). This size category also
includes imposing creatures such as dragons and giants.
 Large size includes galleons, aircraft carriers, airships, spaceships, walking fortresses
and rare colossal beings such as space whales or titans – these are entities that the PCs
won’t fight directly in most normal campaigns.
Entities above large size (such as a planet-sized starship) are to be treated as
environments and do not participate in conflicts (but the group might fight a portion
of them, such as a large-sized antimatter cannon).
» INTERACTIONS
During combat, the three sizes interact in the following ways:
 Small entities interact normally with small and medium entities. They can also affect
large entities, but only through dedicated Clocks, Projects, or Rituals.
 Medium entities interact normally with any size.
 Large entities interact normally with medium and large entities. However, if a large
entity causes a small entity to lose any amount of Hit Points, that small entity is
automatically reduced to 0 Hit Points.
The expectation is that small and large entities will almost never interact directly,
since one would quickly annihilate the other.
66
W
» VEHICLES AS NPCS
If you need to create a full profile for an enemy vehicle, you may simply design it as a
creature belonging to the construct Species.
 If the vehicle is operated by a Villain, it must be treated as a form of that Villain and
it gains access to their pool of Ultima Points, as well as to all special rules that define
Villains (see Core Rulebook, page 100 onwards).
 If the passengers of the enemy vehicle can keep fighting after the transport has
been destroyed, they must be treated as a second phase of the battle and given a
separate combat profile.
 In a battle where the PCs are aboard vehicles and face off against human-sized
troops, describing those troops as swarms (see Core Rulebook, page 297) is a simple
but effective way to express the scale of the battle. The same method works well for
conflicts where the heroes fight aboard their group vehicle (see below) against flocks
of adversaries or enemy fighters.
As always, the aim is to avoid unnecessary complications, taking advantage of classic
JRPG-style conventions to handle a wide variety of scenarios and situations without
changing a single rule.
THE GROUP VEHICLE
This last optional rule is more complex, and it is available to those PC groups who
have obtained a medium- or large-size transport fit for combat situations. By using
this option, our heroes can enter conflicts against enemy vehicles and foes of similar
size aboard their very own group vehicle.
Examples: a fierce chase through an asteroid field, with swarms of federal fighters
in pursuit; a battle against a flying military fortress; the last clash with the Supreme
Villain, who has fused their soul with a gargantuan alien lifeform.
All the rules described in the following pages apply only during conflicts. Outside of
them, the group vehicle only possesses its travel-related abilities (see page 125 of
the Core Rulebook and page 78 of this book).
This rule should only be used if you expect at least one third of the campaign’s battles
to take place aboard the group vehicle. It is particularly fitting for games where a
Player Character has acquired the Stolen Transport Quirk (see page 127).

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» CREATING A GROUP VEHICLE
The group vehicle’s profile must be created collaboratively between the Players and
the Game Master, following a set of specific rules:
 It is created as a soldier-rank construct whose level is equal to the highest level
Player Character present in the group when it is obtained.
 Whenever the group rests in a port, shipyard or any other location where some
maintenance is possible, the vehicle’s level is updated (becoming equal to that of the
highest level PC in the group) and its profile can be freely modified and rewritten by
the Players and Game Master, once again collaboratively. Make sure to describe the
new customizations!
 It can have up to 3 basic attacks, and has 3 more Skills than a normal construct
of its level. However, it cannot gain any Class Skills and it cannot acquire the Extra
Initiative and Use Equipment NPC Skills.
 It deals 5 extra damage with attacks and spells. Additionally, as its level increases,
the vehicle receives all Attribute increases and bonuses to Checks and damage listed
on pages 302 and 303 of the Core Rulebook (see steps 4 and 8).
 It should have access to at least 3 different damage types between its attacks, spells,
and other abilities. This is a fundamental aspect, because the Game Master must have
enough creative freedom when designing adversaries.
 It does not have an Initiative score.
Remember to give the vehicle a memorable name: from now on, it has very much
become a member of the main cast!
» THE GROUP VEHICLE DURING CONFLICTS
When a conflict is heavily focused on vehicles and transports, and/or involves
adversaries of medium or large size, the Game Master may declare that the group
vehicle is available for that specific battle (provided it is accessible story-wise).
If the group agrees to this option, all the rules described on the next page will apply
to the scene. In order for the game to go smoothly, the conflict should only include
the PCs and their enemies; any allied NPCs should be limited to the scenic role of
extras, or join the battle aboard their own vehicle, which takes its turns independently
of the group vehicle.
68
W
 When determining participants, each PC must declare whether they will join as a
crewmember of the group vehicle, or if they will join as an individual PC located
outside the group vehicle (this second option is designed for Pilots whose personal
vehicle is of appropriate size – see page 65).
 The vehicle cannot participate in the Initiative Check, but the crewmembers can.
 When a crewmember would take their turn, instead, the group vehicle obtains a turn,
during which its actions are chosen by the Player controlling that crewmember. If the
vehicle is affected by turn-related effects (see Core Rulebook, page 77), those effects
are based on the vehicle’s turns (they do not depend on a specific crewmember’s turn).
 The group vehicle begins each conflict with maximum Hit Points equal to
【the maximum Hit Points indicated on its profile, multiplied by the number of
crewmembers】, a Crisis score equal to half its maximum HP, current Hit Points and
Mind Points equal to its maximum scores, and with no status effects.
 If the group vehicle falls to 0 Hit Points, it automatically Surrenders and becomes
inactive until the end of the conflict. The Game Master can apply Surrender
consequences to the vehicle itself or to its crew, however they prefer.
PCs who take the role of crewmembers must not be treated as being “present on the
scene” and only gain access to their own abilities as described below:
 When the vehicle performs a Check, any crewmember can spend Fabula Points to
invoke Bonds and/or Traits (this includes the vehicle’s own Traits).
 The vehicle has access to all Rituals available to its crewmembers. Additionally, when
the vehicle casts a spell during its turn, it also has access to all spells known by the
crewmember who is currently controlling it.
 During its turn, the vehicle may spend Mind Points from the crewmember who is
controlling it instead of its own MP.
 The vehicle may perform the Inventory action during its turn, spending Inventory Points
from the crewmember who is controlling it. The vehicle only has access to the following
items: remedy, elixir, tonic, and elemental shard.
 When the vehicle performs the Study action during its turn, the crewmember who is
controlling it may apply any abilities and effects that grant benefits to Open Checks and
to Checks performed to examine creatures, locations, or items.

» EXAMPLE: THE GLADSHEIMR
And now, here’s a sample group vehicle: the Gladsheimr is the starship led by

obtained through the Stolen Transport Quirk (see page 127).

perform a free attack with Lasgun Batteries against that enemy (after their attack has been
resolved), but without the multi (2) property. If it does, treat the High Roll of the Accuracy Check
as 0 when calculating damage dealt by this attack.
These rules rely on the fundamental premise that the entire battle will be
handled as a form of self-contained minigame, and that both crewmembers
and independent Player Characters will remain such for the entire conflict (no
one enters nor leaves the group vehicle). If the group boards an enemy vehicle
or the second phase of the conflict features personal scale combat, switch to
the normal rules.
WARNINGS
70
W
In a context where technology (discussed from page 76 onwards) is central to both
aesthetics and narrative, one might expect magic to be sidelined and become a mere
justification for the most spectacular and implausible abilities. This is not the case:
spiritual energy and supernatural forces are still one of the game world’s main tenets.
These pages provide tips and advice for managing magic and Rituals in your techno
fantasy campaigns.
MAGIC AS A SYMBOL
In techno fantasy, magical and spiritual energy always play a symbolic role in the
story, which may vary based on the themes that the group chose to explore during
world creation. It is good practice to define these aspects as early as session zero (see
Core Rulebook, page 145).
» THE EXPLOITATION OF RESOURCES AND CREATURES
If the campaign explores the exploitation of natural resources and living beings,
magic will be something that Villains see as a tool or an energy source: deprived of
all mystery and marvel, it is valued only insofar as it is profitable and controllable, and
the same will be true for human lives.
For example, magical energy could play the role of electricity within the circuits
that power home appliances and machinery. Alternatively, crystallized magic could
be radioactive – harnessed in special plants, with its residues illegally disposed of,
compromising the balance of the soul stream.
The last idea, which is especially useful if you use the optional rules for technospheres
(see page 130), can lead to several consequences:
 Over the course of the campaign, the group will discover the existence of a more
ancient, complex, and spontaneous form of magic, now long forgotten… or perhaps
deftly hidden to maintain an energetic monopoly.
 Fixing the stream of souls may quite likely not be possible: it was changed
forever, contaminated by pollution, and plundered in the name of efficiency and
productivity. The antagonists will exploit this point of no return to justify their
egotistic actions, while the protagonists are tasked with avoiding the catastrophe
and finding hope in the world that will come.
MAGIC AND RITUALS
W
71
W
2
THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIETY
If, instead, the theme of the campaign is more social and philosophical, then the
stream of souls becomes crucial because it contains the echoes of people’s thoughts,
fears, and desires. Through it, one can communicate, but also manipulate public
opinion and even create life forms.
For example, the campaign might take place between two maps: on the one hand, a
cyberpunk megacity, on the other, a parallel spiritual world reflecting the ways in
which humans perceive reality.
This idea is explored more thoroughly on page 74 with the soul network. It is ideal
for the Esper Class (see page 150) and the Diabolist Quirk (see page 122), and it has
some interesting consequences:
 Spellcasters and hackers essentially overlap: this premise should guide both your
aesthetics – digital witches, executive sorcery, encrypted amulets etc. – and your
approach to different situations: the “virtual parallel world” becomes a place to explore,
with its mysteries and threats.
 If the soul stream’s reactions to people’s emotions and
convictions are central to the campaign,
then demons should be too: after all, this
Species is born from thoughts and they
can even regenerate after being
destroyed if the feelings they
embody are still widespread.
“You may think that
psy-space demons are
virtual, but they are
far from harmless.
If you lower your guard,
they’ll fry your brain.”
72
W
» EXISTENTIALISM, FAITH, AND DESTINY
Lastly, if you decide to focus your campaign on the themes of human existence and
its nature, as well as its destiny and the forces ruling it, the stream of souls may be
something that arrived from beyond. It becomes a supernatural presence that is now
inextricably entwined with the life of the game world – its origins and purpose are
mysterious and unknown, hinted at in mythology and religious faith.
For example, magic and life may have originated from a planet-sized egg containing an
alien entity that is still growing at the center of the galaxy. For millennia, ancient people
worshiped the egg and built cyclopean portals to reach it. The location of these portals
was discovered only recently. What will happen to magic and the soul stream once the
egg hatches? Does all life in the universe exist solely to feed this entity?
Though it does not violate the Pillars, this option is rather delicate because it makes
the stream of souls an intruder. It also lets you set your campaign in an alternate
version of our world, changed by a fictional past event.
 Normally, revelations regarding the stream of souls are a plot twist that takes
place in the second half of the campaign, introduced by the Game Master or by
using a Fabula Point. If you define this feature during world creation, the Player
Characters should either be unaware of it or reveal that they knew about it all
along when a dramatically appropriate moment comes.
 Some Villains will already have understood the true nature of magic but have
hidden or distorted this knowledge to remain in power – for example, becoming
cult leaders – or have turned it into an obsession – for example, believing they
are destined to absorb the whole universe within themselves and be reborn as an
all-powerful god.
 In these worlds, magic tends to have a ritualistic and miraculous role and is usually
reserved for churches and cults whose teachings and sacred texts have hidden
interpretations and provide historically inaccurate versions of past events, sometimes
out of ignorance, sometimes to ensure the populace’s obedience.
 The final battle will likely be against a Villain who absorbed the stream of souls.
Victory will free humanity from a literal form of divine tyranny. But what will happen
to the world and to magic? Will magic also be free, or will it dissolve forever? What
will happen to the machines and creatures whose existence depended on it?

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
MAGIC, VERSION 2.0
Since Fabula Ultima’s Core Rulebook and High Fantasy Atlas use aesthetics and
concepts more closely linked to the fantasy style found in classic JRPGs rather than
those from science fiction, you may find it challenging to imagine the magic abilities
of some Classes within a futuristic context. Here are some tips.
 Arcanist. Arcana could be psychic images, “photographs” of concepts and emotions
disseminated through the soul network (see the next page). Or, they might be the
dying remnants of entities who protected the world before industrial exploitation
irreparably wounded it.
 Chimerist. You could reinterpret the Spell Mimic Skill with a scientific twist – the
study of genomes, DNA, or of a creature’s “magic organs”. It could also derive from a
character’s unique mutations.
 Elementalist, Entropist, and Spiritist. The spells from these Classes could come from
studying the stream of souls – which may even be a basic educational requirement
in their world. You could also consider them to be super powers.
 Chanter. This Class, found within the High Fantasy Atlas, is ideal for playing
celebrities or idols who use their songs and music to fight the system. They could
even use drones to amplify their voices.
 Symbolist. The Symbolist is another Class from the High Fantasy Atlas, who could
become a magical street artist or even a hacker – their symbols rewrite the fabric of
reality but rely on special cartridges for cooldown.
Remember that none of these changes should affect the rules for spells and Skills,
nor make any of them easier or harder to use – though their narrative implications
can, of course, change.
For example, if a Player decides to describe their Elementalist’s spells as a swarm of
drones that emit elemental energy, nothing should affect the drones that would not
influence a normal spell. Likewise, the Player Character should not be able to cast
spells “remotely” against targets they cannot see.
74
W
THE SOUL NETWORK
Though it is not mandatory, techno fantasy campaigns benefit from this small tweak:
transform the stream of souls, which is mentioned among the game’s Pillars on page 14
of the Core Rulebook, into a soul network that transfers information and energy.
In essence, in Fabula Ultima’s techno fantasy settings, technological progress has
relied on the existence of the stream to create inventions that, in our world, are based
on electromagnetic waves and electrical impulses.
The following pages contain tips on how to include the concept of a soul network
in your games. Note that this concept is introduced almost by default if one or more
Players choose the Esper Class (see page 150).
» EXPLORING THE SOUL NETWORK
If the soul network appears under the guise of an actual, self-contained space in your
setting, such as a form of cyberspace or a parallel universe, certain consequences
are likely:
 Terminals. There will be private and public devices through which anyone can
interact with the network or even enter it without needing special prerequisites or
powers. However, any actions not in line with those sanctioned by the authorities will
require Rituals or Projects, following the normal rules.
 The map of the network. If the campaign takes part partially in the real world and
partially in the network, it is helpful to create maps of both, though the Game Master
should not be solely responsible for defining all the details of a location so crucial for
the story. Additionally, the soul network should have its own regions, mysteries, and
threats, and maybe even its own population – most of the time, these will be creatures
from the demon Species.
 Distorted spaces. The spiritual dimension is not necessarily a reflection of the real
world: the entry and exit portals in two locations several days away from each other
could actually be very close within the network, which would allow the group to cover
significant distances quickly.
Clearly, this type of soul network will attract greedy antagonists, making it a place of conflict.
W
75

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
» TIPS FOR USING THE NETWORK
There are countless interpretations of the soul network, and many ways it can be used:
it is very important for Players and Game Master to properly address these during
World Creation. Usually, the network can play one of these roles:
 Telecommunications network. The network enables several forms of long-distance
communication using devices such as cell phones, tablets, or computers. In other
words, the good old Internet…
 Hyperspace travel. Spaceships can travel between different solar systems using
devices or portals that allow them to enter the soul network, find proper coordinates,
and exit near the destination. This process allows ships to “jump” a distance that would
take hundreds or thousands of years to cover moving through “real space”.
 Manipulating memory, behavior, and perceptions. If the soul network allows
access to the consciousnesses of individuals, there may be systems and procedures
designed to use the network to absorb information quickly, recalibrate emotions,
or even alter memories.
 Home of the Arcana. Arcana could be more or less sentient psychic echoes living
within the stream of souls. If the soul network has a map, perhaps each Arcana
could act as the ruler of one of its regions, and may have also sired a specific
lineage of demons.
 Technospheres. If you use the optional rules for technospheres (see page 130
onwards), mnemospheres and hoplospheres could derive from the condensation of
specific instincts or emotions within the stream. This phenomenon could be greater
in those places where the soul network is denser and where information clusters and
data tied to a certain concept aggregate.
Each of these interpretations of the network carries several implications, but you don’t
necessarily need to discuss all of them at the start of the campaign. Instead, use the
existence of the soul network to introduce new plot elements during play.
“Rejoice, my sinners!
Soon, you shall witness the glory of the Divine,
and your minds will exist only by its blessing.”

Clearly, technology is widely spread and central to techno fantasy settings – artificial
or mechanical elements integrate with magic and everyday life, changing both forever,
and reshaping concepts such as mundane and extraordinary, as well as the pacing of
the campaign and the vastity of its setting.
EVERYDAY LIFE
Depending on the level of tech in your setting, the Player Characters may have many
gadgets and services at their disposal, especially in more urbanized areas.
Here are some examples:
 Portable coms. If people have access to cell phones, headgear, or other devices that
allow for long-distance communication, you should define the signal’s range in broad
terms – regional, continental, planetary, interplanetary, or even interstellar – and how
it is transmitted. These devices may also provide instant translation, perhaps using
the transferral of concepts through the soul network (see the previous page).
 Images and video. Characters often have access to recording and image reproduction
devices. This makes storing information much easier but also makes surveillance
systems more common and efficient.
 Public transport. Techno fantasy settings often have buses, trains, cruise ships, and
commercial airplanes. Ticket prices vary by route – you can use the service costs
found on page 125 of the Core Rulebook without any changes.
 Vending machines. Cities could have vending machines that offer Inventory Points.
More exclusive machines could even sell equipment or technospheres, if you use the
optional rule on page 109.
 Hospitals and clinics. Medical treatment is generally widely available and easily
accessible. As per Fabula Ultima’s fantasy approach, this usually takes the form of
magical healing that uses gadgets and high-tech catalyzers.
You can use any of these elements to showcase the differences between poor and
privileged areas, the ways in which antagonists manipulate access to services, and the
gentrification processes used to strain citizens both physically and psychologically,
sabotaging any rebellion process from the start.

CHAPTER
CYBERNETICS
Prosthetic limbs and cybernetic implants are recurring tropes in the techno fantasy
genre that carry within them some important considerations:
 They tell a story. A character’s implants should tell a story about them: the risks
they took, the hardship they survived, or even just the way they chose to live their
life, shaping a body in which they feel at ease and that can fully express their spirit
and identity.
 Rules. Cybernetic implants do not provide any mechanical benefits by default.
However, you can express their impact through Skills or equipment. For example,
an Elementalist (see Core Rulebook, page 186) could manipulate magic thanks to a
neural implant, while custom weapons (see page 112) could represent integrated or
transformable armaments, and so on.
 Transhuman characters. If implants and synthetic bodies are common, the Player
Characters or Villains could use the Surrendering and Escaping options (see Core
Rulebook, pages 89 and 101) to avoid death by transferring their consciousness into
a spare body through the soul network (see page 74) – but what happens to the PC’s
equipment? Can the system transfer it as well? By the same logic, a Sacrifice would
compromise the backup beyond repair. Should the campaign use the optional rule for
integrated technospheres (see page 130), the characters could change their abilities
by placing the spheres directly within their bodies.
Importantly, implants do not have an intrinsically positive or negative connotation
– quite the opposite. What makes an implant a symbol of freedom or oppression are
the circumstances that led to a character using them, as well as the right to decide
whether to use them or not.
78
W
COLOSSAL AND FANTASTICAL MACHINES
Techno fantasy machines and vehicles should be extraordinary and incredible:
An armored city-state that moves on metal legs, with a soulstream extraction
plant in its belly.
A secret military station carved into a giant asteroid, camouflaged amid the debris
and defended by swarms of starfighters.
A hyperspeed corporate train that travels along the liquid surface of an oceanic
planet using gravitational propulsion.
Do not let realism or plausibility bog you down – instead, strive to express the role
of a machine through its appearance as well as its relationship to the surrounding
environment.
SPACE TRAVEL
Interplanetary travel (within the same solar system) and/or interstellar travel
(between different solar systems) are typical tropes in science fiction, but they require
special adjustments in Fabula Ultima.
» MAP MANAGEMENT
The base map sheets represent a planet’s surface, so they’ll need some tweaking for
campaigns that move between solar systems or galaxies.
 First, you need to decide if travel in the campaign will occur on the same or different
scales and if each of these scales requires a map. You can download the new
interstellar and interplanetary sheets on www.fabulaultima.com.
 Determine the length of a travel day within the interstellar sheets, as usual. On
the system sheets, the relative position of planets is constantly shifting – traveling
between planets requires 1d6+1 days, while moving between a planet and its
satellites takes 1 day.
 During interplanetary and interstellar travel, the threat level is higher in the areas
closest or farthest from the system’s star or the galaxy’s center, while it is lower in
the intermediate areas.

THE WORLD
CHAPTER
For example, a space opera-style campaign might only use interplanetary scale maps
representing the various solar systems. Each planet becomes a simple location, while
interstellar travel happens through “instantaneous jumps” between ancient portals
of unknown origin.
» PROPULSION
Usually, the technology used for space travel is crucial to the setting: it can be a rare
fuel, mysterious alien monoliths connecting different galactic regions, space-time
distortions created with Entropism, or even “jumps” through parallel psychic or spiritual
dimensions (as suggested on page 75).
» SERVICES AND TRANSPORT
If the campaign requires space travel, you can use the services and transports shown
below. The “distance” column shows the respective travel day multipliers for planetary,
interplanetary, and interstellar travel.

Playing Fabula Ultima in a techno fantasy setting is an excellent opportunity to go
wild and create futuristic equipment with extraordinary properties.
This section contains tips to help you imagine and describe compelling techno
fantasy equipment, followed by a list of new rare items you can include in your
campaign or use as inspiration… plus some rare weapon modules for the new Pilot
Class (see page 158)!
TRADITION, MAGIC, AND TECHNOLOGY
A typical aspect of techno fantasy is the hybridization of traditional fantasy elements
and futuristic tech. This mix also reflects on the characters’ equipment.
 Classic weapons, reconceived. Swords with energy cells that infuse the blade
with bolt damage, carbon fiber bows and crossbows relying on laser pointers to
increase precision, shuriken drones, magic detection scepters covered in arcane
circuits, and much more. You can describe high-tech versions of all weapons in the
Core Rulebook without changing their parameters or the way they interact with
Skills and effects.
 Futuristic shields and armor. Your characters’ protection can take the form of
partial exoskeletons, shields made of light but extremely resilient polymers, or
even portable forcefield projectors. Once again, you do not need to change the
rules for these objects. For example, even if you describe it as a deflector chip, a
runic shield still uses the character’s off-hand slot, is considered a martial shield,
and prevents you from using the Dodge Skill (see Core Rulebook, page 203).
 Strange prototypes and unusual weapons. Even if these items are not Artifacts, it
is still a good idea to define whether any of the character’s gear and equipment is
especially unusual or even unique, while keeping in mind that they still need to be
able to obtain alternate and improved versions of these objects. You could describe
variations as new ammo types, power cells, special paintjobs, or even optimization
algorithms and protocols, all of which can be activated or deactivated through the
Equipment action, the same way a normal item would be equipped or unequipped..
All things considered, the best techno fantasy equipment takes Fabula Ultima’s classic
options and reinvents their appearance as sci-fi variants.

CHAPTER
AMMUNITION AND LETHALITY
Regardless of how complex and devastating techno fantasy weapons might be, you
still apply the normal rules: you do not need to keep track of ammo, and the only
potentially lethal blows are the ones that reduce their targets’ HP to 0.
BROADER CHOICE, FROM THE START
The basic equipment (see Core Rulebook, pages 130–133) will probably not cover
the entire needs of most techno fantasy campaigns. For this reason, we recommend
using the rules for custom weapons (see page 112) and allowing the purchase of rare
items during character creation – but you still need to pay for these objects using
your starting zenit.
You can create these starting rare items together with the rest of your group, or choose
them from the lists found in Fabula Ultima’s various publications. For instance, a
character using a sniper rifle could select an istinggar (see Core Rulebook, page 274).
If even this is not enough, and you want equipment modding to become a key aspect
of your campaign, you can use the optional rules for technospheres described from
page 130 onwards.
SCIENTIFIC AND PHILOSOPHICAL REFERENCES
When you think about names for the most potent techno fantasy rare items, it is
normal to draw inspiration from theories, technical terminology, and more or less
obscure figures from psychology, philosophy, physics, mathematics, and theology.
Examples: Aleph, Animus, Coriolis, Ego, EMP, Flux, Galvanic, Gaussian, Geiger, Gnosis,
Id, Laplace, Lovelace, Multidimensional, Nadir, Noumenal, Omega, Ontological, Parsec,
Positronic, Pulsar, Quantic, Schrödinger, Trichiliocosmic, Trinity.
These terms come from our world’s history, but JRPGs – and thus also Fabula Ultima
– never needed a justification for them.
However, it is always a good idea to do some research on the things you draw inspiration
from, to avoid reproducing or promoting reactionary and anti-scientific theories.

Though the term “artifact” might seem mostly connected to magic and antiquity, these
objects still have a fundamental role in techno fantasy campaigns.
THE KEY TO REALITY
In techno fantasy campaigns, artifacts often appear as keys or codes that grant
access to a revolutionary or shocking piece of information about the world, its past,
or even its future. These revelations usually show that governments and authorities
have manipulated and falsified historical events to justify their power and cruelty.
However, as the campaign unfolds, it is common for the protagonists to encounter
artifacts that question the very nature of reality, including the origin of the universe,
and its destiny.
RELICS FROM ANOTHER TIME
Sometimes, techno fantasy artifacts come from an age that is far removed from the
present time. They are usually archeological finds revealing past truths and powers,
but they could also be paradoxical relics from a future that, due to said artifact’s
existence in the present, is destined to come true or be radically changed.
INCREDIBLE TECHNOLOGY
You can consider the most extraordinary and dangerous pieces of technology as
artifacts. Remember to also grant them some magical aspects, so the Player Characters
can use a wider range of approaches when interacting with them.
Example: a spiritual energy weapon that can level entire regions, a radio frequency
allowing communication with mysterious cosmic entities, a colossal robot made
invincible by many magical barriers.
“TRUE” MAGIC
In techno fantasy worlds, the most powerful, ancient, and spontaneous spells are
generally forgotten or “smothered”. However, they often gain new life as artifacts, as if
their energy had condensed and taken physical form within an object that can, in a
climactic moment of despair, unleash the magic of the past.

AION
A towering mecha of white metal.
This colossal robot’s armor is snow-white with gold and silver inlays. It was recovered
from deep space and then moored near the Babylon Solar Station. Its origin and the
technology used to craft it are unknown.
Because of its massive size, scientists believe a whole crew is needed to pilot Aion (see
large size group vehicles, page 65). However, this is only a theory since, despite the joint
efforts of the system’s most influential institutions and corporations, this huge machine
still lies inert. Does it need a special key? Upon observation, one feels that the powereddown
lights within Aion’s helm await the arrival of something… or someone.
ALIEN UMBILICAL CORD
The unsettling remains of a massive and segmented tentacle-like organ.
This umbilical cord was extracted from the remains of a mysterious creature. Its
structure and molecular composition indicate that it comes from another universe.
Even so, it is possible to extract genetic material from it. It seems the cells can
strengthen the body, though some test subjects displayed sudden and irreversible
physical and behavioral mutations. They often stare out into the distance or tilt their
heads as though listening to a sound no one else can hear.
ARK OF HOPE
The remains of an ancient alien vessel, lost in space.
This huge alien spaceship is among the past century’s greatest discoveries. It was
spotted adrift near a dangerous asteroid field, its hull torn in several places. Apparently,
only those with a specific genetic makeup, likely belonging to the people who created
it, can pilot the ship.
The ship’s systems hide traces of a sleeping consciousness whose main code is guarded
by the central core, which is still sealed. What would happen should it awaken? What
is also hidden in the core?
90
W
THE BLACK GEAR
A toothed disk that absorbs all light around it.
At first glance, this artifact appears entirely composed of shadow: the strange metal
it’s made of can be safely handled only by organic beings – if it touches a machine,
the gear slides inside the structure and fully subjugates it to the will of its master,
whose identity and location are as of yet unknown.
The gear can even spread its corrupting influence to other damaged units near an
already infected machine. Corrupted, non-sentient machines can only be used by the
gear’s owner, while androids and robotic machinery become true soldiers ready to
serve the will of its master.
CLONING VAT
A large basin full of shiny green liquid. Something moves within.
A creature sleeps, sealed within this large capsule, immersed in greenish slime. The
cloudy liquid conceals their shape, but the body looks incomplete, as if partially
devoured or… not yet “mature”.
This artifact can clone any living creature: the result is indistinguishable from the
original, but it instantly liquifies into a gelatinous puddle if its Hit Points or Mind
Points are reduced to 0. Unfortunately, the capsule hides a subtle mechanism: with
each use, the soul of the original creature becomes fragmented as it gives life to the
copy. Those who overindulge in its use will lose their identity completely.
DEMON DOWNLOADER
An electronic bracelet with a small touch screen.
Though almost identical to a normal smartwatch, this bracelet contains one of the
few copies of the Lemegeton.apk program, which can find and temporarily summon
entities from the soul network (see page 74). The process is the same as a Ritualism
Ritual with medium or major potency. The user still has to negotiate a contract with
the demon summoned, although cruel magic or tech could evade this restriction,
forcing the demon into compliance.
If the demon grants their help, this artifact’s bearer gains access to a specific spell or Ritual
discipline – chosen by the GM – as long as the contract’s terms are respected. They can also
ask a demon to negate the entire Mind Point cost of a spell or Ritual, though this always
ends the contract. Each demon can only be placed under contract once.

EUSCAL INC. FOLDER
An overflowing collection of incriminating documents.
This single-copy folder is the only hope for uncovering the crimes of the chemical
megacorp known as Euscal Inc.: it contains evidence on the corruption of high
officials and threats against unions and reporters, as well as on the violation of many
international treatises and the use of paramilitary forces to occupy and control the
poor neighborhoods where Euscal built its waste-disposal facilities.
Whoever has this artifact holds Euscal’s destiny in their hands. But sharing its content
also means granting the formulae and dangerous inventions to the corporation’s
competitors... which is bound to attract the attention of several Villains.
M-DYAD MODEL
The hilt of a sword found in a mysterious lab.
This artifact’s origins are unknown, and it may be much older than its appearance
suggests. When its wielder focuses their will within the hilt, it manifests a long and
shining blade in which light and shadow intermingle. However, the Dyad will test the
wielder: if they are found unworthy, they are drained of all energy and immediately
reduced to 0 Hit Points.
When wielded by someone who is worthy, the Dyad becomes a rare transforming
custom weapon: each form belongs to the sword Category, one deals light damage,
the other dark damage. The Dyad can also be used to absorb and shatter magic and
supernatural effects: this functions like an Entropism Ritual with no Mind Point cost
and a Difficulty Level that varies based on the power of the magical effect.
NEPHELE SYSTEM PLANS
A palm-sized disk.
Already known for its ruthless and cruel efficiency, Olympia Defense Systems truly
surpassed itself with its Nephele System: an independent orbital station, remote
controlled, that can choke entire planets with a dense miasma, blocking sunlight and
condemning the inhabitants to a fate worse than death. This disc holds intel on the
project’s few weak points: the galaxy’s last hope.
92
W
PULSAR MORPHMODULE
An eye-catching injector containing a swarm of shining nanobots.
This artifact can fuse with any means of transportation, encasing it in an aerodynamic
exoskeleton. The protection is very flashy and tough, and it amplifies the transport’s
performance, removing all Vulnerabilities and granting a +2 bonus to any Open or
Opposed Checks to which it can contribute.
The Pulsar Morphmodule also grants the vehicle enough energy to move at lightspeed
for exactly one second, after which this artifact deactivates until it is exposed to
extraordinary heat.
SCARLET KEY
A thin, laminated red card covered in circuits.
Strange magitech circuits cover both sides of this card, forming the arcane symbol of
the planet Mercury. Sooner or later, this artifact draws the attention of anyone with an
affinity for magic or arcane knowledge. It holds a power as simple as it is incredible:
if placed within any device connected to the soul network (see page 74) which has
an attached card reader, it allows its user and their companions to enter a cyberspace
“bubble” where the device’s software and hardware become a sort of dungeon; these
elements can thus be influenced from within the cyber dimension. The card’s opposite
side is used to return to the real world, possibly exiting from a different device far
away from the first one, but connected to it by the soul network.
SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION PROTOCOL
An enigmatic tablet, its surface covered in fine writing.
Traces of this paradoxical object are found within many chronicles, legends, paintings,
and photographs from the most disparate times and places, usually coinciding with
revolutions, transformations, and profound social or technological shifts.
This artifact draws from the fabric of the soul network (see page 74) to reshape an
individual’s mind and memories. The information used may come from the past or the
future, for the stream of souls is eternal and entwined with the very concept of time.
Ironically, the one thing that the Spiritual Reconstruction Protocol cannot create is a
soul. It instead makes a cold and heartless husk, only to disappear within the folds of
space and time, following its own mysterious logic.

CHAPTER
UNIVERSAL SOURCE CODE
A featherweight globe of iridescent, vibrant light.
A sphere of condensed code that the bravest Soul Divers say is hidden in the depths
of the soul network (see page 74). Its data is believed to reveal the spiritual structure
of the known world: changing it would mean changing reality itself, reshaping both
space and time. However, the whole code seems to wince with each use, as the artifact
becomes heavier and denser. Perhaps, within it, something grows.
WARPSLICE ENGINE
A huge device akin to a triple-barrelled railgun.
Despite its fearsome appearance and the current configuration (designed to connect it
to the hulls of star cruisers and warships), this artifact was not originally meant for war.
It is, instead, a complex force-projection system: it marks three real vertices and then a
fourth imaginary one situated within a parallel dimension. Then, it nullifies the partition
of space located within this tetrahedron, forcing a dimensional rift to open. The engine
requires extreme precision and computational power: the slightest error would allow
unknown forces to cross the rift, with catastrophic consequences.
WORLD TEAR
An alabaster stone, marred by a single dark crack.
This small, tear-shaped white stone is marked by a dark crack along its surface. The
crack’s origin is unknown: it could be tied to an ancient form of magic or be the
embodiment of the exploitation and pollution of the stream of souls.
Whoever holds the World Tear in their hand can feel the joy and pain of the planet.
Moreover, they are temporarily able to perform Spiritism Rituals to communicate
with the soul stream… and to unleash ancient and long-forgotten powers, should
they wish to do so.
“I was betrayed in my time, but this wondrous object
gave me new hope. I shall break your obscene revolution
and bring forth an order of immaculate purity!”

CHAPTER
This chapter is dedicated to the creation and growth of techno fantasy Player Characters
– to take full advantage of its content you have to pair it with the Press Start chapter
of the Core Rulebook (from page 145 onwards). All the options contained here are
designed to be compatible with those presented in other official Fabula Ultima
Atlases. When deciding which additional mechanics to include in your Fabula Ultima
JRPG campaigns, the whole group should consider what fits the narrative context and
the needs of all who participate – take good care of your play experience!
This chapter contains two main sections:
TECHNO FANTASY HEROES
Here you will find tips and suggestions for Players who are about to create a character
and play in a techno fantasy campaign, including several examples of PCs that make
use of the techno fantasy rules and options presented in the following pages.
NEW OPTIONS
Here you will find new rules and mechanics designed for techno fantasy PCs but
compatible with any Fabula Ultima campaign:
 Custom weapons. New rules to create unique, futuristic weapons.
 Techno Fantasy Quirks. New techno-fantasy-style mechanics that enrich and add
depth to your characters.
 Technospheres. A new method for building and evolving your character: Class Skills
and special abilities are tied to your equipment, allowing you to mix-and-match.
 New Classes. Three new futuristic Classes: the enigmatic Esper, the dangerous
Mutant and the highly modular Pilot.
 New Heroic Skills. Eighteen new Heroic Skills that augment the options found
within the Core Rulebook and provide power-ups and support for the new Classes
introduced in this Atlas.

While they are still heroic individuals, the main characters of techno fantasy campaigns
have a number of noticeable peculiarities that would normally only feature this heavily
within very specific characters in other campaigns.
The premise of these pages is that techno fantasy campaigns are rife with critical
reflections on contemporary society and the role of heroism in a cold and complex
world. If you prefer a more classic tone, it is better to stick to the themes and ideas in
the Core Rulebook and the High Fantasy Atlas. The options provided by the rest of
this chapter are fully compatible with those settings.
TORMENTED AND REBELLIOUS SOULS
Usually, techno fantasy characters have a tense and conflicted relationship with their
own past, as well as with themselves and the society they live in.
 A troublesome past. Techno fantasy characters often hide a complex personal history
and have come into contact with numerous groups, factions and even antagonists
before the beginning of the campaign. You do not have to establish all these details
during character creation, though. On the contrary, the best thing to do is for the Game
Master to ask the Players a few questions regarding the PCs’ history, and for the Players
to introduce revelations and plot twists via Fabula Points during the campaign.
 A rebellious spirit. Under no circumstances would techno fantasy characters
compromise or cooperate with those who hold power. These characters always
follow their own moral code, fighting to their last breath to protect the weak and the
outcasts. They feel a burning desire to change the world and they are very aware that
this can never be painless: the time to act is now, even if it means that things will get
worse before they improve.
 A new family. All techno fantasy characters have one thing in common: they feel
they do not belong in mainstream society, some because they were ostracized, others
because they rejected it. Even so, they are not lone heroes. On the contrary, they
yearn for each other’s support, knowing very well that only with such help they have
a chance to fight against the system without losing themselves.
Techno fantasy PCs are quite different from the typical heroes of a Fabula Ultima
campaign. They are not powerful or celebrated heroes who protect the balance
threatened by Villains, but rather, subversive characters that take upon themselves a
terrible burden: fighting against the most callous and merciless impulses of humanity,
to build a kinder, more open and compassionate world… despite the odds.

PROTAGONISTS
CHAPTER
HANDLING YOUR THEME
It is pretty common for newly created techno fantasy groups to have Themes of Doubt,
Guilt, Anger or Vengeance. After all, these heroes are often wounded people fighting
the world. Still, during the game, it is important for them to move beyond this phase
and resolve their inner conflicts by cooperating and trusting each other, becoming
rebellious heroes driven by emotions such as Justice, Mercy and Hope.
ANGRY, NOT EVIL
Techno fantasy campaigns will often see you playing characters that are furious,
headstrong and ready to fight to their last breath to protect what they love and take
down those in power. When witnessing such persistence and some of their most
extreme acts, you might even glimpse a spark of what often drives Villains.
What makes them heroes, then?
 They protect the weak. These heroes take up arms against the powers-that-be and
their willing accomplices. They do not strike indiscriminately, nor use force to impose
their will upon the innocent.
 They value life. Given the chance, techno fantasy heroes will sacrifice their own life,
rather than asking someone else to do the same. If their actions cause pain or death,
they shoulder the burden and learn from it.
 They do not yearn for power. Even after taking down a tyrant, these heroes refuse to
take the throne, because that would make all their struggles meaningless.
If, during a campaign, a Player realizes that their character has moved too far from
these core tenets to ever go back, it is a good idea to turn the character into an NPC
(perhaps even a Villain) and introduce a new protagonist.
SAMPLE TECHNO FANTASY CHARACTERS
The following pages provide profiles for ten Player Characters designed for techno
fantasy contexts. In contrast to the new Classic Characters (see page 146), these
examples focus on the thematic construction of the heroes and provide some tips on
how to grow these characters and their role in the story.
All characters in the following pages use the optional rules for Quirks (see page 120)
and some have custom weapons (see page 112).

CAMNOS
BASIC INFORMATION
CAMNOS IN DETAIL
Identity: Survivor of the
Dust People
Theme: Anger
Origin: Broken Canyon
Quirk: Survivor
Signature weapons: Ice axes
 Thirty years ago, the Triumvirate of Victoria forced the Dust People to
leave their lands, rich in minerals, and settle in the Broken Canyon,
a region filled with unstable spiritual radiation. When the AdAstra
company developed a technology to transform the deadly radiation
into electricity, the secret services staged a series of fake episodes of
civil unrest and raids, culminating in a massacre. Only Camnos and a
few others survived.
 Camnos spent many years wandering far and wide, facing many
dangers, as his body was gradually altered by life in the Canyon.
His Classes are Chimerist, Mutant and Wayfarer. He also learned the
Elemental Shroud spell thanks to the Survivor Quirk.
 Camnos carries two ice axes, his faithful companions in many ascents
and explorations.
 Camnos’ Player should be the go-to person for all information
regarding the Dust People’s culture, the territories near the Broken
Canyon and the dastardly tactics of Victoria’s army.
 Camnos is filled with Anger and the other characters should help him
direct his rage to effectively strike down enemies, but also prevent
him from being consumed by it. The deadliest battle will be fought
in his own heart.

COMMANDER SKADI
BASIC INFORMATION
SKADI IN DETAIL
Identity: Masked Princess of the
Space Pirates
Theme: Justice
Origin: Unknown
Quirk: Stolen Transport
Signature weapons:
Laser Halberds
 The mysterious heroine known as Commander Skadi is a wanted
criminal in all the star systems of the Imperial Crown. After stealing the
experimental vessel Gladsheimr (see page 69) from the forge-world of
Vulcanus, she and her crew started a veritable campaign of raids and
sabotages against the imperial army.
 Skadi’s Player should not establish her Origin or her real name;
in agreement with the rest of the group, they can introduce these
elements as a plot twist at the most opportune moment.
 Skadi’s Classes are Fury, Orator and Pilot. Behind her elegant
appearance and regimented bearing, her desire for Justice burns
bright, and it is most apparent when she fights at the helm of her
modified starfighter.
 The Game Master should involve Skadi’s Player when defining
any information about space pirates and groups of anti-imperial
revolutionaries, not to mention the mysteries of the Gladsheimr.
 Although Skadi is the captain of her ship and the rest of the PCs will
likely become the crew, she is not the “main character” of the story–
she is just a (dangerously) well known face in the Galaxy and she will
probably take the role of a mentor to younger characters.

ELLIOT LANCRIS
BASIC INFORMATION
ELLIOT IN DETAIL
Identity: Young Renegade Pilot
Theme: Guilt
Origin: Aurosian Union
Quirk: Repentant Enforcer
Signature weapons:
Engine spears
 Separated from his unit during a skirmish along the border with the
Republic of Eidos, private Elliot Lancris of the mechanized infantry
witnessed the massacre of numerous civilians at the hands of
Phantom-Class Infiltrators. When the Union’s news networks covered
up the slaughter, labeling the victims as terrorists, Elliot defected the
army and joined a group of dissidents, bringing along his mecha and
the engine spear to start it.
 The Repentant Enforcer Quirk and the Theme of Guilt highlight how
Elliot’s story has just begun: he will face the ghosts of his past as the
game progresses.
 Elliot is a Guardian, Pilot and Weaponmaster and his fighting style is
based around the Protect and Counterattack Skills.
 The Game Master should involve Elliot’s Player in establishing any
elements pertinent to the Union, its most prominent members and
the typical strategies employed by its army.
 This character adds some pretty strong themes to the game:
imperialism, militarism, war crimes and propaganda are just the tip
of the iceberg. The group should be very clear about the appropriate
lines and veils, and regularly check to confirm that the events of the
campaign are not triggering or offensive to anyone at the table.

GAR.NET
BASIC INFORMATION
GAR.NET IN DETAIL
Identity: Cyber Mascot
Theme: Duty
Origin: Network Depths
Quirk: Cognitive Ghost
Signature weapons:
Cooling fans
 Born when a cluster of secret data mysteriously gained sentience in the
depths of the soul network, Gar.net took the name and appearance of
the mascot of a company that produces hardware and software.
 Gar.net’s memory is quite fuzzy: and reasonably so, since he became
aware of his own existence only a few days ago.. Nevertheless, he
remembers catching a glimpse of a mysterious figure when he awoke
and that he has a Duty to perform: stopping the machinations of Halve,
a multinational corporation that owns the most important social
networks and wants to use the soul network to control how the general
population acts.
 Gar.net is a support specialist, combining the Esper, Loremaster and
Spiritist Classes, and his cooling fans are a custom weapon of the
arcane Category.
 Gar.net’s Player should be the go-to person for everything that
pertains to the soul network, its mysteries, and the secret data
that form the base of the character– which should provide many
opportunities to use Fabula Points.
 During the campaign, Gar.net should discover more about his birth
and the mysterious figure that he saw. Was it his creator? Or perhaps
a silent antagonist?

PHOENIX IGARASHI
BASIC INFORMATION
PHOENIX IN DETAIL
 After a very rough career start in the upper echelons of Nova Island,
attorney Phoenix Igarashi accepted the case to represent a young
syndacalist lady during a trial against the Ministry of Law and Order.
When his client withdrew the accusation after being threatened by
the police, Phoenix decided to investigate further. Scuppered by his
colleagues and assaulted by militant nationalists, he survived, thanks
to the unexpected intervention of a mysterious mercenary.
 Phoenix’s desire for Justice is never sated. He has assembled a group of
activists affiliated to the anti-corporate movement GEA and he believes
the woman who saved his life to also be part of this organization.
 Phoenix’s Classes are Orator, Sharpshooter and Weaponmaster. His
transforming briefcase (see page 113) can be used as both a melee or
ranged weapon to inflict a number of status effects.
 The Game Master should involve Phoenix’s Player in describing the
justice system and the high society of Nova Island, where this character
will likely still have a number of contacts.
 Phoenix brings complex topics into the game, including corruption
within the justice system and the connection between police forces
and nationalist movements; the play group explicitly agreed to tackle
these themes during the campaign.

RECLAIMER TH3
BASIC INFORMATION
RECLAIMER TH3 IN DETAIL
 Centuries ago, the mysterious monsters known as Nephilim attacked
Earth. After a few weeks, the powers-that-be decided to activate the
nuclear option, taking refuge on the orbital ark, known as Last Hope.
There, they started a recovery project based on the deadly Reclaimer
androids, controlled by the artificial intelligence Tisiphone. Th3 was
sent to the surface with the order to exterminate every living creature,
but was captured by a group of Terran survivors.
 The presence of human beings, which Th3 had never encountered, is in
direct contradiction to Tisiphone’s information. Now, Th3 is haunted by
Doubt: perhaps the mission was a lie.
 Th3’s highly advanced system allow it to analyze the environment and
unleash negative energies. Their Classes are Darkblade, Loremaster
and Weapomaster.
 During the game, the Game Master should involve Th3’s Player in
establishing any information about Last Hope and Tisiphone.
 The nature of the Nephilim and the true goals of Last Hope are going
to be among the campaign’s central elements. It’s very likely that Th3
will be forced to defend the Terrans against their fellow androids, and
that Tisiphone hides a terrible truth.

RUBEDO
BASIC INFORMATION
RUBEDO IN DETAIL
Identity: Factory-Grown
Hyperneural Body 003
Theme: Belonging
Origin: Cernunnos VII
Quirk: Neo-Human
Signature weapons:
Airgetlam gauntlet
 Created within the laboratories on Cernunnos VII, Rubedo – the
“magnum opus” of professor Helena Cagliostro – is a neo-human child
gifted with a hyperneural brain cortex, designed to withstand extreme
psychic stimuli and attune with the Airgetlam gauntlet. She was not
meant to be a person, rather an obedient interface to remotely control
the Solais living weapon (see next page).
 After fleeing the laboratory together with Solais, the outside world has
caught Rubedo by surprise; her Theme of Belonging represents how
she is looking for the family she never had.
 Rubedo has the Entropist and Esper Classes. She can deal heavy
damage with her spells as well as the Airgetlam gauntlet, the custom
weapon created through Solais’ Xiphosymbiosis Quirk, which makes
her Resistant to bolt damage.
 Rubedo’s “lost” nature doesn’t mean that the Player should be lost as well,
on the contrary, they should be involved in all the descriptions of the
experiments on Cernunnos VII and the mysteries of the psychic energies.
 The “003” designation in Rubedo’s Identity isn’t just for show: there
are at least two previous versions of the experiment, who are bound to
appear during the campaign.

SOLAIS
BASIC INFORMATION
SOLAIS IN DETAIL
Identity: Symbiotic Weapon –
Airgetlam Beta Class
Theme: Vengeance
Origin: Cernunnos VII
Quirk: Xiphosymbiosis
Signature weapons: Herself
 Despite her humanoid appearance, the Solais living weapon is actually a
swarm of nanomachines, designed to obey the instructions received from
the Airgetlam gauntlet. During her first field-test with Rubedo, Solais
took advantage of the child’s hesitation, going rogue and fleeing from the
laboratory alongside the child, while most of the staff was killed.
 Solais is determined to destroy both her creators and the government
that sponsored the project… even if this means involving Rubedo in
her Vengeance.
 Solais combines the Mutant and Sharpshooter Classes to transform
her own body into a veritable arsenal, but her third class, Guardian,
reveals her protective personality.
 Solais’ Player should provide more details on professor Cagliostro
and the government’s military plans. After all, her awakening predates
Rubedo’s by a long time.
 The relationship between Rubedo and Solais is very delicate and the
entire group has the responsibility to further its evolution during
the campaign. Solais’ Player has to decide if she is going to become
somewhat of an older sister for Rubedo, or if she is going to let her
desire for revenge consume her. The other PCs should offer her as many
occasions as possible to forge new Bonds and become truly free.

TALA RAMI
BASIC INFORMATION
TALA IN DETAIL
Identity: Brilliant Prodigy
of Robotics
Theme: Hope
Origin: Miravi
Quirk: Inventor Prodigy
Signature weapons:
Multifunction wrenches
 One of the most brilliant minds that ever worked for Mycean Robotics,
Tala Rami dedicated her life to the development of prosthetic limbs
and machines that could provide relief in areas stricken by war and
natural disasters. After the death of the founder, Myceans’ board of
directors immediately signed military contracts with multiple nations.
Thoroughly disgusted at the idea that her research would be used to
cause the same kind of harm it was born to heal, Tala ran away, taking
all the encryption keys with her.
 Hounded by Mycean Robotics’ mercenaries, Tala was saved by
the mysterious paramilitary humanitarian organization known as
Blackwell. She is not sure if she can trust them, but she is looking for
a way to maintain Hope.
 Tala’s Classes are Loremaster, Tinkerer and Wayfarer. Her robotic
assistant Lambton protects her in battle.
 Tala’s Player should be the go-to person for all information related to
Mycean Robotics, its employees and, in general, all the most cuttingedge
scientific theories.
 By now, the scientists of Mycean Robotics have rebuilt at least some
of Tala’s research, so the PCs are going to face her own creations, now
twisted into war machines.

WISTERIA
BASIC INFORMATION
WISTERIA IN DETAIL
Identity: Freelance Witch with a
Heart of Gold
Theme: Mercy
Origin: NeonCity
Quirk: Diabolist
Signature weapons: Arcane Uzis
 Wisteria is a Freelance Witch, who lives and works in the futuristic
metropolis of NeonCity, where SoulNet technology allows people to
dive into the Data World, a cognitive reflection of the real city, but
populated by digital demons. She is something of a jill-of-all-trades,
and she often helps those in need without asking anything in return.
Many of her colleagues are unhappy with this attitude and some have
taken advantage of her generosity in the past.
 Wisteria’s familiar, Schrödinger, is a bakeneko, born from the digital
memory of her old cat, whom she loved dearly.
 Wisteria’s Classes are Elementalist, Rogue and Sharpshooter. She can
extract items from her opponents using Soul Steal and brandishes a pair
of arcane uzis, a quick custom weapon that provides +2 Magical Defense.
 The Game Master should involve Wisteria’s Player in everything linked
to the Diabolists, their factions, the relationships between demons and
humans and the dangers of the depths of the SoulNet.
 Wisteria might look like a simple character, ordinary even, but her
generosity puts her at odds with the world she lives in: sometimes a
young cyberpunk witch with a heart of gold is exactly what we need to
remind us what kind of world we are fighting for!

From here on, the chapter focuses on new options and rules designed to enhance the
techno fantasy vibes of your Fabula Ultima campaign. However, if the whole group
agrees, you can use these options for any campaign.
These introductory pages provide preliminary information about the various options,
in terms of both mechanics and play experience, to help you identify the most
interesting ones for your game.
CUSTOM WEAPONS
You can use this rule to create unusual
weapons. It’s a simple and straightforward
option with no profound gameplay implications
– you can always leave it open to anyone who
is interested.
TECHNO FANTASY QUIRKS
This option is more complex and has a significant
effect on character creation. If you use it, each
Player Character gains a set of unique mechanics
defining their abilities and role in the story.
These effects are powerful, ranging from the ability to change
shape to brandishing a relic with extraordinary powers…
Use Quirks if you and your group are comfortable setting aside
the power balance between characters in favor of strong
characterization. This option works best in tight
and collaborative groups and may be too complex
if this is your first experience with the game.

CHAPTER
TECHNOSPHERES
Without a doubt the most complex and radical option among those included in this
book, technospheres allow for a constant and in-depth customization of both the PCs’
Classes and the special abilities provided by their equipment.
With a simple change of weapon or armor, a dedicated spellcaster might become a
powerful warrior or a careful sage.
When you use this option you are assuming that in this particular game world there
are magical devices that are able to transfer complex abilities from one person to
another: this makes magic less “magical” and strongly highlights its transformation
into a good and an object. Moreover, this special rule requires far more detailed
management of the characters’ equipment, which might not suit some groups.
NEW CLASSIC CHARACTERS
These sample techno fantasy builds expand on those provided in the Core Rulebook
(see page 172), expressing the full potential of this Atlas’ new Classes. You will also
find two premade Groups to draw inspiration from – one features characters sharing a
common Class, the other with greater variety.
NEW CLASSES
The Techno Fantasy Atlas introduces three new Classes for Player Characters. They
are designed to interact normally with those found in the Core Rulebook and other
expansions without needing any modifications. The following pages contain
some practical tips for Players and Game Masters to get the most out of these
new Classes.
NEW HEROIC SKILLS
This last, lengthy section contains eighteen new Heroic Skills. Some are tied
to the new Classes from this Atlas, but most add options for those found in
the Core Rulebook.
“I didn’t ask for them to create me.
But I’m going to choose my own future.”
110
W
ESPER
 This Class is extremely flexible based on the Player’s selection of gifts, and offers
excellent synergies for any character who focuses on combat, as well as those who
prefer defense or support. The main challenge to make the most out of the Class is
handling the Brainwave Clock, which makes gifts progressively more powerful, but
also more expensive. Manage their use carefully.
 If there are any Espers in the group, the soul network (see page 74) will probably
become central to the campaign. The Game Master should rely upon the Esper
Player(s) to establish the true nature and inner workings of journeys into the network,
not to mention the creatures and dangers that dwell within it.
 An Esper with the Navigator Skill that uses support abilities based on sound (like
the Orator’s Encourage Skill or the Chanter’s Magichant Skill – see Core Rulebook
page 201 and High Fantasy Atlas page 137 respectively) is essentially able to take
part in a conflict while being in another place. It might seem that they are “cheating”,
but it is important to highlight that if their allies are defeated they are going to lose
the ability to influence the scene (since they were doing it through those very same
allies). Moreover, in Fabula Ultima the safety of the PCs is already guaranteed: the true
consequence of defeat is losing what you care for or watching helplessly while your
friends get captured. Given that, if the idea of a character that helps their friends from
behind the scenes rubs you the wrong way, just avoid this specific kind of Esper.
W
Although Classes like Esper, Mutant and Pilot have futuristic names, that does
not mean that they are appropriate only to a techno fantasy context:
 The Esper is suitable for any character with psychic powers, divinatory
or telepathic abilities, or based on a fighting style that emphasizes
concentration and force of will.
 The Mutant is a good fit for any character able to change shape, partially
transform into animals or altered by magical energies.
 The Pilot is suitable for inventors and rebels with a steampunk or
renaissance look, but also warriors that don massive magical armor or
ride artificial steeds.
IN OTHER CAMPAIGNS

PROTAGONISTS
CHAPTER
MUTANT
 Although the Mutant Class focuses on sacrificing your own life force to change your
body, that does not mean its mutations have to be visceral or biological: the same
results can be achieved by a swarm of nanomachines that overcharge their own
circuitry or a wizard who burns their own spirit to assume animal forms.
 The Mutant has a set of Skills tied to unarmed strikes and spending Hit Points to
modify their own body to gain new powers: while these abilities synergize extremely
well with those of the Fury and the Darkblade, this Class is equally effective for
characters who use Mind Points and, in particular, offensive spells (r).
 In most cases, the Mutant did not have a say about their condition. Whoever is
responsible should be one of the campaign’s main antagonists, perhaps the final one.
The Game Master should involve the Mutant’s Player in the creation and description
of the laboratories and the creatures experimented upon.
PILOT
 The Pilot is an unusual Class, offering a wide variety of options that improve the
parameters of almost any kind of character, but which don’t strongly define it. The PC’s
other Classes will dictate their style.
 Even when they ride their personal vehicle, the Pilot can communicate with their
allies and the outside world, help reach Objectives, and much more. The vehicle
should be mostly regarded as an “alternative equipment set” and it is wise not to
lose oneself in the technical details (this is a JRPG after all!).
 Take your time to consider what kind of role vehicles (especially the Pilot’s) are going
to have in the campaign: are exoskeletons and mechas a common sight or an oddity?
Are they considered war machines? In what kind of situations are they supposed to
be employed? Scenes and conflicts should always allow the Pilot to take advantage
of their special Skills, otherwise it is better to use only the exoskeleton frame or
perhaps even consider a completely different Class.
 In a campaign focusing on space battles, the Pilot might fight aboard their personal
vehicle rather than a group vehicle (see page 66). In this case, the Pilot is not
consider a member of the crew.
“This world is in shambles and it falls to us to fix it.
The anger you feel… use it wisely. It’s valuable, but volatile.”

The majority of JRPG protagonists wield unique weapons that reflect their style and
are an expression of their personality – from battle umbrellas to gun axes, nothing
should be considered too impractical!
The following rules allow you to create a custom weapon for your hero during character
creation. Later on, the Game Master can create rare versions of these weapons as per
the normal rules in the Core Rulebook (page 268). You can find sample rare custom
weapons in the following pages.
Custom weapons aren’t necessarily better than normal basic weapons – choose what
to use based on what fits your personal vision of the character.
CREATING A CUSTOM WEAPON
A custom weapon starts with the following characteristics:
 It belongs to one Category of your choice (arcane, bow, brawling, dagger, firearm,
flail, heavy, spear, sword or thrown).
 It is not a martial weapon (E), but might become one depending on the
customizations that are chosen for it (see below).
 It is a two-handed weapon and cannot benefit from the Monkey Grip Heroic Skill
(see Core Rulebook, page 238); in short, a custom weapon will always occupy both
hand slots.
 It is a melee weapon or a ranged weapon (your choice, and regardless of the Category
you previously chose for it).
 It has a cost of 300 zenit.
 Its Accuracy Check relies on【 DEX + INS】 o【r DEX + MIG】 (your choice).
 It deals physical damage equal to【 HR + 5】.
A custom weapon also receives three customizations from the list on the right.
 Each customization can only be chosen once for each custom weapon.
 Choosing a customization marked with E turns the weapon into a martial weapon.
 If a customization says “you”, it refers to the character who has the weapon equipped.
 Some especially powerful customizations count as two customizations or increase
the cost of the custom weapon.

for the sake of your Skills (for instance, Defensive Mastery or Dodge – see Core
Rulebook, pages 197 and 203).
Elemental
Choose air, bolt, dark, earth, fire, ice, light or poison. The weapon now deals damage
of the chosen type instead of physical, and also deals 2 extra damage.
Magic Defense Boost E
You gain a +2 bonus to Magic Defense.
Powerful E
The weapon deals 5 extra damage, or 7 extra damage if it is a heavy weapon.
This customization is not available for arcane and dagger weapons, or for weapons
with the quick customization (see below).
Quick (counts as two customizations) E
When you perform the Attack action and choose to attack with this weapon, you may
perform two attacks (against the same target or against different targets). If you do,
both attacks follow the rules for two-weapon fighting (see Core Rulebook, page 69).
Transforming (increases the custom weapon’s cost by 100 zenit)
This weapon has a second form, which must be designed as a separate custom weapon,
must have the transforming customization, and doesn’t cost you any zenit.
While you have one of the two forms equipped, you can equip the other form whenever
you want. During a conflict scene, you can only do so during your turn, before or after
an action, and only once per turn.
If one or both the forms are martial (E), remember that you must have the appropriate
Classes to equip them. Additionally, a transforming weapon can still only have one
Quality (the Quality applies to both forms).

COMPATIBILITY
Custom weapons allow you to create the most bizarre armaments you can imagine,
but at the same time, efforts have been made to keep them somewhat balanced. For
instance, one might argue that a quick and accurate custom weapon is always better
than a pair of steel daggers, but there is a loss in flexibility because you can’t combine
that custom weapon with a different weapon – there’s pros and cons to each choice.
TRANSFORMING WEAPONS
The transforming customization is by far the most complex option provided by custom
weapons. One important note, however: if one form of your weapon is a melee weapon
and the other is a ranged weapon, or if they belong to different Categories, you only
gain the benefits of one form at a time.
For instance, if you use a weapon with a melee form and a ranged form, you won’t be
able to add both Powerful Shot and Powerful Strike to damage, or to Counterattack
while simultaneously having Crossfire available.
A character wielding a transforming weapon is always free to decide which form they
start with at the beginning of a conflict.
SAMPLE TECHNO FANTASY CUSTOM WEAPONS
The following pages showcase a few examples of techno fantasy-style custom
weapons, accompanied by possible rare evolutions. The following conditions apply:
 You may never wield a custom weapon in a single hand, not even decreasing its
damage by 4 as indicated on page 268 of the Core Rulebook.
 When it comes to transforming weapons, any modification (extra damage, Qualities,
Accuracy bonuses etc.) is automatically applied to both forms.
Sometimes, a Player Character’s custom weapon will also be something they hold dear.
In that case, it can be a good idea to describe later rare variants as “upgrades” of the initial
weapon, instead of completely different items (for instance, they might be described as
gems slotted inside a sword, or unique cartridges for a firearm). However, the rules and
mechanics that govern items and equipment should not be altered.

Quirks are an advanced optional rule that provides strong thematic and mechanical
options for Player Characters. The Quirks presented in these pages were written with a
techno fantasy assumption, but may be used in any campaign; you may also use them
as reference to create your own Quirks – but you should only use those if the rest of
your group agrees to it.
 A Player Character may only ever have one Quirk.
 If you use Quirks in your game, it is strongly suggested that each Player Character
begins play with one. Additionally, no two characters in the same group should have
identical Quirks.
 On average, a group of Player Characters with access to Quirks will be able to tackle
more challenging situations than what would be normal for their level.
 If it makes sense in the story, a character may lose their current Quirk and gain a
different one – discuss this with the group.
USING QUIRKS IN YOUR GAME
Quirks should be seen as a mechanical and narrative reinforcement of your characters’
unique nature. Keep the following in mind:
 Quirks shape the game. Even a less impactful Quirk is a powerful statement about
your character and their role in the story. If you pick Fugitive Experiment, you are a
lifeform no one has ever seen before; if you pick Cognitive Ghost, the soul network
and the creatures inhabiting it will become an important part of the game. Quirks
take the already heroic Player Characters and kick them up a notch, which can prove
a bit overwhelming. Think carefully before you use them!
 Freedom of choice. You don’t need a Quirk for your character concept to be valid. If
your Identity is that of a World-famous Inventor, you shouldn’t feel forced to pick
Inventor Prodigy for that Identity to be relevant to the story.
 How to use Quirks. These options should be used to bring interesting situations into
play, to give your character unique issues and problems to confront, and to provide
additional mechanical support for their Traits.
 How not to use Quirks. These options should never be used to make your character
stronger than the rest of the group, to steal the spotlight, or to bring sensitive topics
that make others uncomfortable into play.

You have been riling people up to fight against oppressors for years, perhaps for
justice, perhaps for vengeance. Who is your current main target? Who or what did you
lose because of your insubordination? Who or what is hunting you down?
When you rest inside or near a settlement, you may choose one option: you learn what
the locals are mainly angry about or afraid of, or you create a contact that lives and
operates in this area – give them a name and specialization, and the Game Master tells
you what they ask of you (they might request a payment or need help).
Examples: Miqe the Witch, an expert ritualist willing to help in exchange for rare
materials; Two-fingers, a weapon dealer currently held prisoner by the Planetary
Security Corps.
» COGNITIVE GHOST
You are a presence born within the depths of the soul network, straddling the line
between demons and humans. Do you remember your earliest moments? What belief,
memory or emotion do you embody? How did that shape your appearance?
Choose two damage types from air, bolt, dark, earth, fire, ice, and light. You gain
Resistance to the chosen damage types. However, you also gain Vulnerability to a third
damage type chosen from the list above.
You gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Ritualism discipline, and you may use
these Rituals to transport creatures in and out of the soul network, as well as to gain
information and track entities while inside the soul network.
122
W
» DIABOLIST
You have access to a unique talent or device that lets you shape the energies of the
soul network into a demonic familiar. How did you obtain this power, and what price
did you pay? What does your familiar look like, and what does this say about you?
Together with your group, create your familiar: a level 5 NPC belonging to the demon
Species (see Core Rulebook, page 302). This creature has no initiative score and does
not level up, can have a maximum of two basic attacks, gains a +3 bonus to Accuracy
Checks and Magic Checks, and their maximum Hit Points are equal to【 five times the
familiar’s base Might die size + half your level】.
When you reach level 20, your familiar gains an additional Skill. At level 40, your
familiar gains another additional Skill. Make sure to discuss these Skill choices
together with the rest of your group.
When an NPC you can see that belongs to the demon Species falls to 0 Hit Points,
if you are present on the scene, you may spend 20 Mind Points. If you do, the Game
Master reveals that creature’s entire profile, and you may replace one of your familiar’s
Skills with one of that creature’s Skills (the Game Master has final say on which Skills
are eligible and how they apply to your familiar). Describe the transformation!
If you have this Quirk, you may not acquire the Faithful Companion Skill from the
Wayfarer Class (see Core Rulebook, page 217), and vice versa you can’t gain this Quirk
if you already acquired Faithful Companion.
Your familiar doesn’t get an independent turn during conflicts, but you can use an
action to have them perform an action (once per turn). If your familiar is affected by
any turn-related effects (see Core Rulebook, page 77), these are based on your turn.
Your familiar joins and leaves scenes when you do, and gains your same benefits for
rests. If reduced to 0 Hit Points, your familiar vanishes from the scene and reforms at
your side at the start of the next scene in which you are present, with current HP equal
to their Crisis score.

CHAPTER
» ENIGMATIC RELIC
You possess a strange weapon capable of shaping the weave of reality, an artifact from
a forgotten past (or perhaps even a far away future). How did you obtain it, and how
did you discover the basics of its functioning? Who is trying to take the relic from you?
Together with the rest of your group, create a relic: a rare custom weapon (see page
112) worth 1200 zenit or less. The relic is an artifact, may only be destroyed through
a PC’s Sacrifice, and may only be stolen from you or lost due to a Surrender.
As long as a Player Character or Villain has the relic equipped, they may perform the
Skill action to have it manifest a power of their choice from among the following:
 (PCs only) Ask the Game Master a single question. The Game Master answers
truthfully and describes the visions shown by the relic.
 Choose a discipline from among Chimerism, Elementalism, Entropism, Ritualism,
and Spiritism. Until the end of the scene, any character who has the relic equipped
may perform Rituals of that discipline and their MP cost is halved.
 Until the end of the scene, all attacks with the relic deal 5 extra damage, and all
damage dealt ignores Absorptions, Immunities and Resistances. Additionally, the
character may immediately perform a free attack with the relic.
The second and third options are cumulative with themselves. For instance, using
the second option for Chimerism three times within the same scene will make it so
that Chimerism Rituals cost 1/8th of the normal MP.
After the relic manifests a power while in the hands of a Player Character, it generates
1d6 Paradox Points. If the relic’s Paradox Points ever reach 10 or higher, all Paradox
Points are immediately lost and the Player rolls a d6:
 1–4: the relic becomes completely inert and cannot be equipped until a specific
condition is fulfilled (the Game Master decides what it is).
 5–6: the relic unleashes a terrible and unprecedented force, causing death and
destruction, a serious alteration of time and space, or even the advent of a new threat
for the world (Game Master’s choice).
When a Villain uses the relic’s power, it never generates Paradox Points.
If you Sacrifice yourself and the relic is not destroyed as part of the Sacrifice, it remains
a part of the campaign with all the above rules intact, but can now be lost or stolen
like any other object (it can still only be destroyed through a Sacrifice).

» FROM A DISTANT WORLD
Your presence here is an anomaly, and sometimes you really do seem to follow your
own rules. Do you come from a far away planet, or perhaps a different timeline? How
did you get here, and when? Do you think you still have a chance to go back, and
would you do so? What terrible threat followed you?
When you participate in a conflict scene, you automatically gain 1 Fabula Point.
Additionally, you can invoke a Trait to reroll dice even if you fumbled your Check (if
you do so, you do not receive a Fabula Point for the fumble).
» FUGITIVE EXPERIMENT
Engineered within a secluded laboratory, you are a being with no precedents. The
world is not ready for you, and neither were your creators. How did you escape? What
are you searching for? Who was the first person to show you kindness?
When a rule or ability requires you to spend 100 or fewer Hit Points, Mind Points, or
Inventory Points, you may suffer 1d8 Instability Points to ignore that cost.
At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), you lose 1d6 Instability
Points (to a minimum of zero).
If your Instability Points ever reach 10 or more, you are immediately reduced to 0 Hit
Points and must Surrender. The consequences of this Surrender should be closely tied
to you losing control of your abilities. Then, you lose all Instability Points.
» HUNDRED FACES
You can disguise yourself as pretty much anybody else. Does this ability come from
special gadgets, psychic powers, or a unique physiology? Who was the first person to
see through your deception? Whose trust did you lose because of it? Who tried to hire
you for an unsavory operation, and how did you respond?
If you are away from prying eyes, you may use the Skill action and spend 1 Fabula
Point to disguise yourself as another creature of humanoid size and shape. If the
creature is someone you had a chance to meet, observe or research, you may also
adopt their voice and mannerisms.
Your disguise will reliably fool any soldier-rank creature, but elite- and championrank
creatures might see through it due to a failed Check or opportunity. If a Villain
is present on the scene with you, they may spend 1 Ultima Point to reveal your true
identity through sheer coincidence or superior intuition.

dangerous discovery have you made, and which shady company is trying to steal that
information from you? How do they plan on using it?
Once per conflict scene, if you need to spend Inventory Points, you can instead ignore
that cost.
You may initiate Projects. If a Project requires a special ingredient or material, you
may spend 1 Fabula Point to declare you have that item with you. If you do, the
invention must have a terrible flaw (see Core Rulebook, page 134).
» NEO-HUMAN
You represent the next evolutionary stage of humanity (or at least, one possibility).
What gives away your nature? Do you conceal it? Do you have a mentor or someone
you deeply respect? Which entity or organization is keeping a close eye on you?
When you acquire this Quirk, choose Dexterity, Insight, Might, or Willpower.
When you join a conflict scene, you may choose one option: you increase that Attribute
by one die size (up to a maximum of d12) or, if its base die size is d12, you treat it as
having a current die size of d20 during Checks you perform (only during Checks, and
regardless of status effects). The chosen effect lasts until the end of the scene.
When you choose one of the above options, the Game Master gains an opportunity
which can be spent during the current scene or later, to showcase the unexpected
collateral effects of your abilities (such as drawing the attention of a psychic entity,
alerting the authorities to your presence, or damaging the continuum).
» PLANET ORACLE
The stream of souls itself speaks through your mouth, its suffering carved in centuriesold
scars caused by pollution and ruthless experimentation. How does that pain
manifest before your eyes? How was this connection formed?
When you cause one or more allies to recover Hit Points and/or Mind Points, each
of those allies recovers 5 additional Hit Points and/or Mind Points and you choose a
status effect from among dazed, enraged, poisoned, shaken, slow, and weak: each of
those allies recovers from the chosen status effect. The recovery effect increases to 10
Hit Points and/or Mind Points if you are level 30 or higher.
You also gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Spiritism discipline.

You were part of a gang, armed group, police force or military unit. Your hands and
heart are stained with the blood of innocents. What shocking event led to your
defection? Who do you believe will never forgive you, and why are they right not to?
You may acquire this Quirk only if your character’s Theme is Doubt or Guilt, and your
Theme cannot be changed in any way as long as you have this Quirk.
When you acquire this Quirk, describe the organization you worked for, name the
Villain who leads it, and list their three main strategies. That organization becomes
a threat for your world.
Examples: the Galaxy Crossroad Corporation (led by Aaron Callisto) who seize
natural resources from planets, diminish worker rights and colonize outer space;
the Deluvian Security Forces (led by Natalia Caiden) who use excessive force, traffic
prototype magitech armaments and spread misinformation; the Peckerson Private
Company (led by Ezra Allen) who sabotage peaceful protests, intimidate civilians
and infiltrate unions.
You managed to steal something from the organization: you obtain a single rare item
worth 1000 zenit or less. You may choose this item from the available lists or design
it along with the rest of your group.
At the end of each session (approximately four hours of play), if you hindered one or
more of the organization’s strategies, or if you remedied some of the harm they have
done, gain 1 Subversion Point.
If you’re ever unsure whether this happened during a given session, it is you who
always has the final say. Be as honest and sincere as you can.
When you need to spend Fabula Points, you may instead spend 1 Subversion Point
(regardless of the amount of Fabula Points required).
Once the Villain leading the organization is defeated and Surrenders, you lose this
Quirk, permanently increase your maximum Hit Points and Mind Points by 10, and
change your Theme to one of the following: Belonging, Duty, or Justice.

You obtain a transport of your choice from among those found on page 125 of the

enough to accommodate you and the rest of your group plus a dozen guests, and it is
fitted with armaments that allow for vehicle combat (see page 65).

You may not equip any items, with the exception of accessories and weapon and

 You learn one NPC spell (see Core Rulebook, pages 310–311); you cannot choose the
Devastation spell. If the spell requires a Magic Check, use【 MIG + WLP】. Customize

Quirks can often bring complex themes to your table: for instance, Repentant
Enforcer and Survivor revolve around topics of exploitation and oppression;
Fugitive Experiment, Robot and The Beast Who Spoke lead to characters that
are viewed as threats or anomalies; and even characters with the much simpler
Hundred Faces are likely to be met with mistrust and suspicion. When you choose
and customize your Quirks, commit to respecting the personal boundaries of
those who play with you. Use lines and veils (see Core Rulebook, page 140) and
be ready to pause the game if a scene is making someone uncomfortable. Be

Your ability to manifest a physical body is tied to a weapon, which must be wielded
by another person. How were you created? Do many like you exist? Is this your first
wielder? Who did you refuse to join forces with? Do you crave freedom?
When you acquire this Quirk, choose another Player Character to act as your wielder.
You both immediately create a Bond towards each other, which has 1 emotion chosen
from among admiration, inferiority, loyalty, and mistrust.
Make sure the Player controlling the wielder is okay with this relationship and looks
forward to exploring the unique nature of this Quirk with you.
Together with the rest of your group, create your core: a rare custom weapon (see page
115) worth 1200 zenit or less. The core cannot be lost, stolen or destroyed by external
means, but automatically disintegrates if you Sacrifice yourself. It is never considered
martial (E) and anyone can equip it. A character who has it equipped may perform
the Skill action to change its Accuracy Check’s Attributes into any combination of two
different Attributes (apply the change to both forms if it is a transforming weapon).
As long as you have this Quirk, only your wielder may equip your core.
Your current Hit Points may never go below 1– any excess loss of Hit Points is instead
suffered by your wielder (this happens regardless of distance).
When your wielder Surrenders, you immediately vanish, retreating within the core
(regardless of distance) and becoming dormant; you cannot exit until the wielder
regains consciousness. The Game Master may choose to impose the consequences of
such a Surrender on you or on your wielder.
When your wielder Sacrifices themselves, choose one option:
 Awakening (only if your Bonds have total strength 8 or higher). You lose this Quirk
and your core appears in your hands. You immediately perform the Equipment action
for free and equip it on yourself.
 Legacy (only if another willing PC you can see is present on the scene). That Player
Character becomes your new wielder and your core appears inside their backpack.
 Shatter. You Sacrifice yourself in place of the wielder, who immediately recovers Hit
Points equal to their Crisis score and no longer needs to Surrender or Sacrifice.
Whenever you gain a level, if your Bonds have a total strength of 10 or higher, you
may trigger an Awakening as described above (no Sacrifice needed).

Technospheres are crystals in which energy from the worldwide stream of souls

these gems react and alter its characteristics, perhaps even granting new powers

The optional technospheres rules deeply modify many of the mechanics present
in the Core Rulebook, with the goal of replacing part of the complexity instead of
merely adding to it. If you use these rules, all Player Characters in the group must
follow them, without exceptions.
In rules terms, technospheres take many of the features that make up characters and
equipment and turn them into modular options: Classes, Skills, Qualities and more can
now be swapped freely. While these rules are especially fitting for a techno fantasy
context, they can be used in any game.
In general, these rules do not make characters stronger than normal; you could say
they make them strong in a different way.
TYPES OF TECHNOSPHERE
Technospheres are broadly split into two groups: mnemospheres and hoplospheres.
 Mnemospheres (from Greek mnéme, “memory”) are generated by the accumulation of
thoughts, emotions and knowledge present within the stream of souls, and respond
to the stimulus of new events and experiences.
In gameplay terms, each mnemosphere is associated with a Class and grants its user
access to some of the corresponding Skills.
 Hoplospheres (from Greek óplon, “tool, weapon”) are quite literally “clots” of soul
energy tied to a specific element (such as fire or earth) or concept (such as healing or
the casting of spells).
In gameplay terms, hoplospheres reinforce the items in which they are placed or the
abilities of those who equip them.
The following pages include all the rules needed to apply the technosphere system
to your campaign. They are fairly complex, so it’s important for the whole group to try
and memorize them to the best of their ability.

CHAPTER
TECHNOSPHERES CHANGE YOUR WORLD
Technospheres may initially appear as a strictly “mechanical” option, but on the contrary,
they have a strong impact on narration and worldbuilding, as well as the perception of
magic and competence within the setting.
When trying to better incorporate technospheres into your campaign, you might find the
following tips useful.
 What do technospheres look like? How do mnemospheres and an hoplospheres differ?
 How are technospheres created? Is there a faction with a monopoly over them?
 Which hypothetical or legendary technosphere might change the world’s fate?
» THEY ARE NOTHING SPECIAL (OR ARE THEY?)
The fact that you can simply slot a technosphere into a handheld or worn device and
gain some of the typical Skills of a Class, not to mention the fact that people can now
easily switch these abilities in a single gesture, might make these powers appear a bit
less “unique” and “special”, compared to a normal game of Fabula Ultima.
 As a result, in this setting, magic, techniques and personal talents are debased,
turned into a commodity and standardized: every time a new form of art or craft
emerges it is doomed to become the new mainstream standard or vanish, labeled as
not profitable enough or “unfashionable”.
 Those who refuse to rely on technospheres or who improve their abilities in the
traditional way become interesting characters to explore, probably criticized as
backward thinking or mocked for their lack of common sense.
 It is very likely that some lost arts and powerful magics cannot be reproduced using
artificially produced technospheres. In game terms, you can represent this by making
some technospheres artifacts with special abilities out of the ordinary, or by limiting
the list of Classes that can be accessed with a mnemosphere (e.g., the list of suggested
Classes on page 136 does not include the Arcanist, both to avoid some complications,
and because it is a Class that should always be extraordinary in the narrative).
All these elements are further exacerbated if technospheres are sold in shops or
vending machines.
Remember, even if technospheres are a common sight in the setting, for the purpose
of these rules only the PCs use them. Thus, describing an NPC’s abilities as based
upon the use of technospheres is just an aesthetic choice (more on this on page 133).
132
W
» A MONOPOLY ON COMPETENCE
If a single corporation, organization or government controls the mnemosphere market,
that authority also controls how fast people can develop and learn, manipulating their
chances of moving up in the world and achieving success.
 A person can improve their Skills without mnemospheres, but their development will be
far slower compared to simply activating a fully developed mnemosphere.
 From a mechanical point of view (especially for rewards), these rules allow GMs to offer
Player Characters more powerful mnemopsheres (perhaps with some additional Levels
in Skills they have already acquired) after defeating powerful opponents or ransacking
industrial convoys.
Of course, these rules provide many opportunities to explore a wide variety of stories:
from the creation of advanced weapon systems, designed to turn soldiers into an easily
replaceable resource, to destabilizing conspiracies that upset the balance of power
between the nations, offering immediate access to crucial skills and competences to
one or the other contender... in exchange for obedience and favors.
» CONDENSED SPIRIT
Each technosphere is the physical representation of an idea, instinct, inclination,
calling or emotion made manifest: this allows you to use them as a narrative tool to
showcase the true nature of a place or creature, albeit in a rather abstract way.
 As a result, in a world where technospheres exist, the feelings, emotions and suffering
of creatures that live there are so strong (or the stream of souls is so sensitive) that
they often manifest in this condensed and crystalline form.
 Of course, this process can be forced and, in this case, it is important to establish if
there is (or was) a slower and more sustainable way to create technospheres (perhaps
they had a different name and social role in the past).
You can also use technopsheres and change their origin or narrative significance: for
example, they could be jewels created from the memories of the departed, symbiotic
parasites that grant new powers to their host, or crystalized bits of code that
spontaneously appear inside the soul network (see page 74). In all these cases, you
might find the variants presented on page 138 useful.

CHAPTER
EQUIPMENT RULES CHANGES
If you use technospheres, the following equipment rules apply:
 The only types of equipment available in the game are the following: custom
weapons (see page 112), armor, and accessories, plus weapon and armor modules
for the Pilot Class (see page 158).
 Any other equipment simply cannot exist. For this reason, you should ignore the
Dual Shieldbearer Skill from the Guardian Class (see Core Rulebook, page 197) and
turn the magispheres from the Tinkerer Class into an advanced magitech benefit,
removing the magicannon completely (see Core Rulebook, page 215).
 Custom weapons and armor cannot have Qualities outside those detailed in the
chart below, which offer slots in which technospheres can be placed.
 On the other hand, accessories and rare modules for Pilots (see page 86) follow the
normal rules for rare items and cannot have the Qualities listed below.
 In order to lighten the Game Master’s workload, NPCs cannot have the Use Equipment
Skill (see Core Rulebook, page 309) nor use technospheres. Their abilities may be
described as coming from weapons, armor, or technospheres, but they are not treated
as such in terms of rules. To compensate for this disadvantage, NPCs belonging to the
humanoid Species receive one additional Skill.
 Technospheres (both mnemospheres and hoplospheres) and the items that contain
them cannot be destroyed, lost or stolen without the owner’s permission.
QUALITY COST EFFECT
Slot α -
Offers 1 technosphere slot. This Quality is automatically
present on all weapons and armors that have no other
Qualities, at no additional cost.
Slot β +600 z Offers 2 technosphere slots (max. 1 mnemosphere).
Slot γ +1500 z Offers 3 technosphere slots (max. 2 mnemospheres).
Slot δ +1800 z Offers 4 technosphere slots (max. 2 mnemospheres). This
Quality is only available on weapons.
“Centuries of trial, error and failure.
And now, the results are in the palm of a hand.”
134
W
CHARACTER CREATION CHANGES
The following rules apply to Player Character creation:
 Each Player Character is created at level 5 following the normal rules, but must
distribute those levels among exactly three Classes.
 The three Classes chosen this way are considered Innate Classes for that PC.
 Upon creation, each Player Character receives a permanent increase of 5 maximum
Hit Points and 5 maximum Mind Points, and also gains the ability to equip martial
melee weapons and ranged weapons.
 Each Player Character also receives a level 1 mnemosphere of a Class of their choice
upon creation.
Example: a Player Character might begin play with 1 level in Elementalist, 2 levels in
Esper and 2 levels in Spiritist as Innate Classes, plus a level 1 Loremaster mnemosphere.
CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT CHANGES
The following special rules apply to Player Character advancement:
 When a Player Character gains a level, they increase their character level by 1 and
invest 1 level into an Innate Class or into a mnemosphere of their choice, chosen
from those available to the group.
 Over the course of their advancement, characters may invest levels in their Innate
Classes as per the normal rules, but cannot acquire new Classes, not even after
mastering all three Innate Classes.
The character’s maximum Hit Points and Mind Points, as well as the Attribute die size
increases at levels 20 and 40, and any other effects whose power varies based on
level are calculated using the character’s level, which is thus separate from the total
levels in Innate Classes and equipped mnemospheres.
Example: a Player Character might reach level 20 and still have only 5 total levels in
Innate Classes, but with 15 levels invested in a variety of mnemospheres; they still
increase an Attribute by one die size and are treated as a level 20 character for the
sake of calculating maximum HP and MP, as well as any level-based effects.

CHAPTER
BEYOND LEVEL 50
A Player Character who has already reached level 50 cannot further increase their
character level, but they can still receive Experience Points and invest any levels
obtained this way into Innate Classes and mnemospheres.
EQUIPPING TECHNOSPHERES
Technospheres can be freely placed within any weapon or armor fitted with the
proper slots. Anyone who equips the item in question receives the benefits of all
technospheres within it.
 Placing technospheres in an item is a task that demands calm and attention, so it
cannot be done during a conflict.
 The same piece of equipment may contain both mnemospheres and hoplospheres,
provided you stay within the slot limit. For instance, a β Slot can contain two
technospheres at most, only one of which can be a mnemosphere.
 An item cannot contain two or more mnemospheres that share one or more Skills
with each other (including Heroic Skills).
 A character may never equip an item containing a mnemosphere that
grants one or more Skills (including Heroic Skills) they already
have access to (be it through an Innate Class or through another
mnemosphere slotted into a different item they have equipped).
 Some hoplospheres require and
occupy more than one slot.
 You can place two or more
identical hoplospheres
within the same item. This
may cause a coagulation
effect (see page 137).
136
W
MNEMOSPHERE RULES
Each mnemosphere is tied to a specific Class: as it absorbs memories and experiences
it can increase in level and become stronger. The following rules apply:
 For the sake of simplicity and balance, it is recommended that you limit mnemospheres
to the following Classes: Chanter, Chimerist, Commander, Dancer, Elementalist,
Entropist, Esper, Fury, Guardian, Loremaster, Orator, Rogue, Sharpshooter, Spiritist,
and Weaponmaster.
 When a character invests a level into a mnemosphere (see page 134), that
mnemosphere develops a new Skill of the corresponding Class or increases the Skill
Level of a preexisting Skill, just as with standard Class advancement.
 A mnemosphere may contain 5 levels at most. Once it reaches level 5, that
mnemosphere is mastered and develops a Heroic Skill of the corresponding Class, or
a generic Heroic Skill (the Players decide as a group). The requirements of the chosen
Heroic Skill must be fully met by that specific mnemosphere.
 As long as a Player Character has a weapon or armor containing mnemospheres
equipped, they gain access to all Skills (including Heroic Skills) inside it. As soon
as the item is unequipped, they lose all of its benefits and abilities (including, for
instance, spells learned through a Chimerist mnemosphere: those spells are part of
the mnemosphere, not the character).
 Mnemospheres do not grant access to the free benefits of their Classes, nor do they
allow characters to start Projects or perform Rituals (Skills tied to these aspects, if
present, cannot be acquired). Characters who wish to obtain these abilities must do
so through Innate Classes.
Example: if a level 5 Player Character equips a level 5 Guardian mnemosphere
(Defensive Mastery 3; Fortress 2; Bastion) and a level 3 Elementalist mnemosphere
(Elemental Magic 2: Flare, Ignis; Magical Artillery), they essentially have access to
Skills on a par with a level 13 character, including a Heroic Skill.
However, those mnemospheres will not grant any of the free benefits those Classes
normally provide (additional HP and MP, use of martial armor and shields and
Ritualism). That said, the additional HP granted by the Fortress Skill would still apply.
It is a good idea to use mnemosphere sheets in order to keep track of each
mnemosphere’s advancement and make it easy for the group to swap them between
different characters (see page 145).

CHAPTER
HOPLOSPHERE RULES
Hoplospheres are simpler and more immediate than mnemospheres, but definitely no
less important. They follow a few specific rules:
 Hoplospheres replace the normal system for granting Qualities to items, and allow
Player Characters to frequently reconfigure their equipment.
 When placed within a piece of equipment, a hoplosphere infuses it with its power in
a way that is unique to that specific type of hoplosphere.
 Many hoplospheres feature coagulation (Coag.) effects, which are added to the
hoplosphere’s normal effect when identical hoplospheres are placed in the same item.
Example: if you place two arctic hoplospheres within the same weapon, each of
them changes the weapon’s damage type to ice and grants Resistance and Immunity
to ice (thus resulting in Immunity). On the other hand, if you place three gladiator
hoplospheres inside a weapon, that weapon now deals 6 extra damage to humanoids
(2 from each sphere) and also increases the wielder’s Defense score by 3.
Similarly to mnemospheres, hoplospheres are easier to keep track of with digital
support or memo cards so that Players can swap them easily (see page 144).
TECHNOPHERES AS REWARDS
Technospheres work best when the group has a good quantity and variety of them
available: because of this, the basic premise is that these crystal spontaneously
appear in the game world, so that it feels natural to stumble upon some during a
session (such as a Fury mnemosphere generated by the wrath of a rampaging monster,
for instance).
An interesting option is for each new technosphere to offer a brief vision of what
generated it when it is touched: a sound, a memory, an emotion, or some kind of clue.
For the sake of determining rewards or selling price, each technosphere is worth
approximately 500 zenit, and each already-present level inside a mnemosphere
increases its value by 300 zenit.
A list of ready-to-use hoplospheres can be found starting on page 139.
138
W
TROUBLESHOOTING AND ALTERNATIVE RULES
While the rules governing technospheres have been tested and proved to be fairly
robust, they can require some adjustments (as is often the case when an optional
rule has such a profound impact).
For instance, characters based on the Akromorphosis Skill (see page 155) or those
that often rely on weapon and armor modules (see page 161) might find themselves
partially or completely without their mnemospheres and hoplospheres; not only that,
but some groups will likely want to implement technospheres only partially.
Below you can find a list of suggestions that allow you to solve most of these issues
in simple enough ways. It should be noted that the limitations added by these options
are due to the fact that, under their normal rules, hoplospheres and mnemospheres
compete for the same slots and thus balance each other out – if you remove one or
the other from the equation, you endanger that very balance.
 Integrated technospheres. If you use this option, which is especially appropriate for
Mutants and Pilots, the character may place a number of mnemospheres equal to
or lower than【 1 + (the PC’s level, divided by 15)】 inside some device, armband, or
other contraption that offers a narrative justification, to ensure that the Classes in those
mnemospheres remain available. However, the character cannot equip items with δ
Slot, and can only use their equipped items’ technospheres slots for hoplospheres.
 Mnemospheres only. If the group decides to use mnemospheres but would rather keep
the normal equipment rules, they may implement a variant of the rule described above:
each PC can maintain a number of active mnemospheres equal to or lower than【 1 +
(the PC’s level, divided by 15)】, and equipment simply follows the standard rules in
the Core Rulebook. In this case, hoplospheres do not exist, all types of equipment are
once again available for PCs and NPCs, and Player Characters no longer gain the ability
to equip all martial melee and ranged weapons at character creation (they do increase
their maximum HP and MP by 5 and receive an initial level 1 mnemosphere, however).
 Hoplospheres only. If the group wishes to customize equipment with hoplospheres
but without tying Class advancement to mnemospheres, you may apply all
technosphere rules for equipment, but the δ Slot Quality is no longer available.
In this case, mnemospheres do not exist, and Player Characters do not increase
maximum HP and MP by 5 during character creation (they do gain the ability to equip
martial melee and ranged weapons, however).

SAMPLE HOPLOSPHERES
To randomly generate a hoplosphere from the list, the Game Master may roll a d66
(use two d6, one for the tens digit and the other for the units digit).
 Hoplospheres marked with an asterisk (*) can only be placed within weapons,
never within armor.
 The same weapon cannot contain hoplospheres that are tied to different damage
types (for instance, a weapon may contain three Toxic hoplospheres, but not a
Toxic hoplosphere and a Voltaic hoplosphere). This specific limitation does not
apply to armor.
Obviously these are only a few examples of hoplospheres. The Game Master is free to
create more using these as reference, and Players may propose them through a survey
or wishlist (see Core Rulebook, page 123).

Core Rulebook. This may be spent on custom weapons, armor, accessories,
and hoplospheres (500 zenit each).
 Mnemospheres. The character receives an additional level 0 mnemosphere
for every 10 levels beyond 5 (for instance, a level 23 character will receive
one additional mnemosphere, for a total of two initial mnemospheres).
 Levels. The character may distribute their levels as they wish between
their Innate Classes and initial mnemospheres, but must invest at least 5
levels among three Innate Classes.

TECHNOSPHERE SHEETS AND CARDS
This page presents two good options for keeping track of mnemospheres and
hoplospheres: mnemosphere sheets and hoplosphere cards.
You can find blank versions of these at www.fabulaultima.com.
 When developing a mnemosphere, it can be a good idea to give it a custom name
independent of its Class: for instance, an Entropist mnemosphere built to provide
spells that support allies and hinder enemies might be renamed “Controller”,
while a Rogue mnemosphere containing nothing but Cheap Shot levels might be
renamed “Dirty Fighter”.
 Cards are an effective way of keeping track of hoplospheres, but you might end up
with quite a lot of them: a fun and interesting option is to color the circle behind the
sphere’s name in a way that reminds you of its general use and effects. For instance,
hoplospheres granting offensive effects might be colored red, while those granting
some sort of healing or immunity might be colored green, and so on.
This way, when a Player Character places technospheres inside a weapon or armor, the
Player can simply note down the names of those spheres and grab the corresponding
cards or sheets. Coagulating hoplospheres may be put in a stack, as shown below.

ESPER FREE BENEFITS
 Permanently increase your maximum Mind Points by 5.
ESPER SKILLS
COGNITIVE FOCUS (ç5)
At the start of your turn during a conflict, you may choose one ally who is able to hear
you or one enemy you can see that is suffering from dazed, enraged, and/or shaken.
Until the start of your next turn, the chosen creature becomes your focus.
You gain a bonus equal to【 SL】 to Checks you perform to examine your focus, as well
as to your Accuracy Checks and Magic Checks for attacks and offensive spells (r) that
include your focus among the targets. When you cause your focus to recover Hit Points
and/or Mind Points, they recove【r SL × 2】 additional HP and/or MP, respectively.
HYPERCOGNITION (ç5)
The total MP cost of your spells and verses (see High Fantasy Atlas, page 138) that
include your focus among their targets is reduced by【 SL】, or by【 SL × 2】 if your
focus is the only target (to a minimum cost of 0 Mind Points).
NAVIGATOR
You can communicate telepathically with any conscious ally within 1 travel day of you;
you are able to hear each other for the sake of Skills and effects.
You gain the ability to perform Rituals of the Ritualism discipline. Additionally, you
may use Ritualism to transport creatures in and out of the soul network, and to gain
information and track entities while inside the soul network.
PSYCHIC GIFTS (ç5)
Each time you take this Skill, you gain a gift. The rules for gifts and for the Brainwave
Clock can be found on the next page.
PSYCHOKINESIS
When you perform an Accuracy Check, you may replace one of the Attribute dice with
Willpower (such as【 DEX + WLP】 for a shortbow). Additionally, your melee attacks
with weapons belonging to the arcane or sword Categories may target flying creatures.
 How did you develop your psychic abilities? Did someone train you?
 Are your abilities relatively common, or are you the exception?
 Which of your attributes or skills can you strengthen with your psychic arts?
 Which unsettling or unusual quality do your powers possess?
152
W
USING A GIFT
Gifts can only be used when specific events take place. When this happens, you may
spend an amount of Mind Points equal to【 the number of filled sections in your
Brainwave Clock, multiplied by 5】 minimum 5 Mind Points) in order to apply the
effects of that gift to the event.
 You may only use a single gift per event.
 If a gift causes HP or MP recovery, or if it causes MP loss, the amounts increase by 10
if you are level 20 or higher, or by 20 if you are level 40 or higher.
THE BRAINWAVE CLOCK
When you first acquire the Psychic Gifts Skill, you also receive a Brainwave Clock.
 Your Brainwave Clock has 4 sections, and it begins each scene empty.
 After you resolve one of your gifts, fill 1 section of your Brainwave Clock (you do so
after the effects of the gift have been calculated and applied).
 Your Brainwave Clock determines your gifts’ cost in Mind Points, as well as their
effectiveness (see above). You can still use your gifts when the Clock is full.
 Sections of your Brainwave Clock may not be filled in any way other than described
above, and they may only be erased through the Brainwave Discharge Heroic Skill
(see page 171) or through effects that expressly influence Brainwave Clocks.
GIFT EVENT
Atmokinesis When you deal damage
That damage becomes air or bolt, and its source deals extra damage equal to【 2 + the
number of filled sections in your Brainwave Clock】.
Clairvoyance When an NPC becomes your focus or when
you create a Bond towards an NPC
Ask the Game Master a single question about that NPC, which the Game Master must
answer truthfully. Then, describe what sensation revealed this information to you. You
may use this gift only once on each NPC.

damage to one or more flying creatures, they are forced to land immediately.
Life Transference When you cause one or more enemies to lose HP
Choose yourself or an ally who is your focus: if the chosen creature is in Crisis, they
recover an amount of Hit Points equal to【 5 + (the number of filled sections in your
Brainwave Clock, multiplied by 5)】.
Photokinesis When you deal damage
That damage becomes dark or light, and its source deals extra damage equal to【 2 +

Psychic Backlash After an enemy succeeds on an Opposed Check
against you or causes you to lose Hit Points
That enemy loses an amount of Mind Points equal to【 5 + (the number of filled
sections in your Brainwave Clock, multiplied by 5)】. Then, choose one option: that
enemy suffers dazed, or that enemy suffers shaken.
Psychic Shield After an enemy you can see performs an
Accuracy Check or a Magic Check
For the purposes of that Check, you may treat your Defense and Magic Defense scores
as being equal to【 your current Willpower die size + (the number of filled sections in
your Brainwave Clock, multiplied by 2)】. You may still use your normal scores if better.
Reassuring Presence After you cover an ally with the Guard action
That ally recovers an amount of Mind Points equal to【 10 + (the number of filled
sections in your Brainwave Clock, multiplied by 5)】. If that ally is your focus, they
heal from a single status effect of their choice out of dazed, enraged, and shaken.
Thermokinesis When you deal damage
That damage becomes fire or ice, and its source deals extra damage equal to【 2 + the
number of filled sections in your Brainwave Clock】.

MUTANT SKILLS
AKROMORPHOSIS (ç3)
Your unarmed strikes dea【l 6 + (SL × 2)】 extra damage, and you gain a bonus equal
to【 SL】 to your Accuracy Checks with them.
At the start of your turn during a conflict, you may choose a weapon Category other
than brawling. If you do, your unarmed strikes now belong to the chosen Category. If
you choose bow, firearm or thrown, they become ranged weapons instead of melee. If
you choose dagger or sword, they cannot be used with Triple Slash (see High Fantasy
Atlas, page 161). These changes last until the start of your next turn.
BIOPHAGY (ç4)
After one of your attacks or offensive spells (r) causes one or more enemies to lose
Hit Points, if you are in Crisis, you may recove【r SL × 5】 Hit Points.
ECDYSIS
After you lose Hit Points due to damage, if that damage had a type other than physical,
you may spend 10 Hit Points to gain Resistance to that damage type until you use this
Skill again. You cannot use this Skill if doing so would reduce you to 0 HP.
GENOCLEPSIS (ç2)
When you deal damage to one or more NPCs, you learn their Species and the GM
chooses【 SL】 therioforms appropriate to those NPCs (see next page): if you have
acquired the Theriomorphosis Skill, you may immediately pay its HP cost and use it
to manifest those therioforms (even if they are not among those you have learned).
THERIOMORPHOSIS (ç6)
Each time you acquire this Skill, you learn a therioform (see next page).
You may use an action and spend one third of your current Hit Points (rounded down)
to manifest the effects of up to two therioforms from those you have learned. The
details of this transformation are explained on the next page.
 Were your mutations caused by a scientific experiment or by some kind of magic?
 Who is responsible for your mutations? What are your feelings towards them?
 Who was the first person to show you kindness? What did it cost them?
 How do your mutations manifest? What makes them eerily beautiful?
156
W
Therioforms are mutations that grant powerful abilities. The way that they manifest is
completely up to you – Pterotheria, for instance, might turn you into a person-sized
bat or simply give you large feathered wings.
 Once you use the Theriomorphosis Skill, the chosen therioforms last until the end of the
scene. They also end if you die or fall unconscious, perform the Guard action, or use the
Theriomorphosis Skill again (this includes using it through Genoclepsis).
 You may end the effects of your Theriomorphosis at any time, but during a conflict you can
only do so on your turn, before or after an action.
 When a scene ends, if you are under the effects of Theriomorphosis, you may spend 10
Mind Points to extend your current therioforms to the next scene you will be in.
THERIOFORM GENOCLEPSIS SUGGESTIONS
Amphibia Frogs, salamanders, regenerating creatures, aquatic monsters.
You may breathe underwater and your eyes can see perfectly in dim light.
When you recover Hit Points, you recover 5 additional Hit Points and you may
immediately recover from a single status effect of your choice.
Arpaktida Wolves, birds of prey, creatures with sharp hunting senses.
You treat your Insight as if it were one die size higher (to a maximum of d12).
When you deal damage to one or more creatures for the first time during your turn, if
at least one of them is in Crisis, you deal 5 extra damage to each of those creatures.
Dynamotheria Bears, dinosaurs, creatures of massive size and strength.
You treat your Might as if it were one die size higher (to a maximum of d12).
When you succeed on a Check to advance or turn back a Clock, if that Check includes
Might, you may fill or erase 1 additional section of that Clock.
Electrophora Electric creatures, lightning elementals, robots.
When you deal damage with an attack or spell, you may have all that damage become
bolt. While your unarmed strikes deal bolt damage, any enemy who loses 20 or more
Hit Points due to one of your unarmed strikes also suffers slow.
Neurophagoida Parasites, undead, creatures who feed on souls.
When you use the Biophagy Skill, you also recover an amount of Mind Points equal to

Pneumophora Jet-propulsion mollusks, great winged beasts, rockets.
When you deal damage with an attack or spell, you may have all that damage become
air. While your unarmed strikes deal air damage, any enemy who loses 20 or more Hit
Points due to one of your unarmed strikes also suffers weak.
Polypoda Squids, octopi, creatures with tendrils or vines.
Your attacks with unarmed strikes gain multi (3).
Pterotheria Bats, birds, winged insects, flying creatures.
You are able to fly. In addition to the obvious advantages in mobility, your melee
attacks can target flying creatures and you cannot be targeted by melee attacks
unless the attacker is flying or is somehow able to reach flying targets.
These benefits do not apply if you are unable to fly freely (such as when inside a
vehicle designed for human-sized creatures, or in a narrow corridor). Additionally,
when you suffer air, bolt or ice damage during a conflict scene, you lose these benefits
until the start of your next turn.
Pyrophora Bombardier beetles, pistol shrimps, fire elementals.
When you deal damage with an attack or spell, you may have all that damage become
fire. While your unarmed strikes deal fire damage, any enemy who loses 20 or more
Hit Points due to one of your unarmed strikes also suffers dazed.
Tachytheria Cats, gazelles, hares, creatures that are agile and quick.
You treat your Dexterity as if it were one die size higher (to a maximum of d12).

PILOT SKILLS
COMPRESSION TECH
As long as there is no one aboard your personal vehicle, you may have it safely disappear
from the game world at any time. What magic or technology allows it?
If your personal vehicle is not present in the game world and you are in a space big
enough to contain it, you may perform the Inventory action and spend 2 Inventory
Points to have the vehicle appear near you, and enter it for free.
FLEXIBLE CONFIGURATION (ç4)
When you perform the Equipment or Guard action while driving your personal vehicle,
you may choose up to【 SL】 of its enabled modules and disable them. If you do, choose
up to an equal amount of its disabled modules and enable them.
HEART IN THE ENGINE (ç3)
At the start of your turn during a conflict, if you are driving your personal vehicle, you
may spend 10 Mind Points. If you do, choose one option: the next time you deal damage
during this turn, deal【 SL × 2】 extra damage; or, the next time you suffer damage before
the start of your next turn, that damage is reduced by【 SL × 2】 (applied before damage
Affinities); or, you recover from either the slow or weak status effects (your choice).
PERSONAL VEHICLE (ç5)
When you acquire this Skill, you gain a personal vehicle with a frame of your choice
and three different modules of your choice (see next page).
Whenever you acquire this Skill again, you acquire two additional modules of your choice.
STRONG GRIP
When you perform an Accuracy Check with a weapon module, you may replace one of
the Attributes with Might (such as【 MIG + WLP】 for an arcane module).
 Where did you learn to pilot? Is your teacher still alive?
 How did you obtain your vehicle? Did you build it yourself? Did you inherit it?
 What personal touch makes your vehicle stand out from the rest?
 Who or what would you never allow aboard your vehicle?
160
W
A Pilot’s personal vehicle follows a set of special rules.
 Entering the personal vehicle during a conflict requires the Objective action.
Normally there is no Check required, but the Game Master may introduce a Clock if
there are serious dangers or obstacles. If the personal vehicle is accessible when the
conflict begins, characters may enter it immediately before the Initiative Check (see
Core Rulebook, page 59).
 Leaving the personal vehicle doesn’t require an action, but during a conflict it can
only be done on your turn, before or after an action.
 The personal vehicle can contain a variable number of human-sized creatures
depending on its frame and modules, but only its Pilot may drive it. Additionally,
the other passengers cannot cover creatures when they perform the Guard action.
 The maximum number of modules enabled at the same time on a personal vehicle
is equal to【 3 + its Pilot’s SL in Personal Vehicle】. The Pilot may freely reassign
their personal vehicle’s enabled and disabled modules outside conflicts.
A personal vehicle is made of the following elements:
 A frame that informs its general shape: Steed for riding animals, bikes, small
starfighters, skateboards and the likes; Exoskeleton for power armor and mechanical
limbs; Mecha for large combat robots piloted from within. Each Pilot must pick the
frame for their personal vehicle when they obtain the Skill. This remains unchanged
for the rest of the game, so make sure to choose carefully based on your character’s
style and personality, and consider the role they will have in the campaign. For
instance, choosing a fighter plane doesn’t make much sense if your story takes place
in the slums of a cyberpunk megalopolis (how about an anti-gravity bike instead?).
 A variable number of weapon modules, armor modules, and support modules
that can be connected to the personal vehicle’s control systems (enabled) or kept
inactive but still attached to the frame (disabled). Some options, such as the Flexible
Configuration Skill and the Secondary Offensive module, may allow you to quickly
enable and disable modules, or to briefly activate a disabled module.
The upcoming pages contain a detailed explanation of the various module types and
the rules governing them, followed by lists of standard frames and modules.

CHAPTER
ARMOR MODULES
While driving a personal vehicle with an armor module enabled, a Pilot does not
have access to the normal contents of their armor slot. Instead, that slot is considered
occupied by the personal vehicle’s armor module. If the personal vehicle has no
armor module enabled, the Pilot can keep using their equipped armor as normal.
 As soon as the Pilot stops driving a personal vehicle with an enabled armor module,
they immediately regain access to their normal equipped armor.
 Armor modules marked with E are considered to be martial armor for the sake of
Skills and other effects, and they set the Pilot’s Defense and Magic Defense to fixed
scores (bonuses from shields and other effects still apply). Note that a Pilot can still
equip these modules even if they normally lack the ability to equip martial armor.
For instance, a Pilot with the Guardian Class benefits from the Defensive Mastery
Skill while driving a personal vehicle with a Heavy Plating module enabled, but they
do not benefit from the Dodge Skill granted by the Rogue Class.
WEAPON MODULES
While driving a personal vehicle with one or more weapon modules enabled, a Pilot
does not have access to the normal contents of their hand slots. Instead, those slots
are considered occupied by the personal vehicle’s weapon modules. If the personal
vehicle has no weapon modules enabled, the Pilot can keep using their equipped
weapons and shields as normal.
 As soon as the Pilot stops driving a personal vehicle with weapon modules enabled,
they immediately regain access to all normal equipped weapons and shields.
 Each weapon module counts as a one-handed, non-martial weapon for the sake of
character Skills and effects (with the exception of the Shield module, which is treated
as a shield). When you set up your personal vehicle’s weapon modules, declare which
module will occupy your main hand slot and which will occupy your off-hand slot.
 Some weapon modules are cumbersome and prevent you from having other weapon
modules (including Shield modules!) enabled on the same personal vehicle.
For instance, an Axe module can be used with the Counterattack Skill, and a Rifle
module can be used with the Crossfire Skill (see Core Rulebook, pages 219 and 205).
162
W
Because each weapon module is treated as a one-handed weapon, a Pilot driving a
personal vehicle with two enabled weapon modules that share the same Category
benefits from the rules for two-weapon fighting – and if they have the Ambidexterous
Heroic Skill (see Core Rulebook, page 234), this can be done with any two enabled
weapon modules!
SUPPORT MODULES
Support modules provide a variety of miscellaneous benefits; these benefits often apply
to the vehicle’s passengers in addition to the Pilot themselves.
 A personal vehicle cannot have more than one enabled support module of the
same name.
 Some support modules are particularly complex or cumbersome and count as two
modules towards the limit on total enabled modules.
DAMAGE AND REPAIRS
A Pilot’s personal vehicle doesn’t have its own separate stats and is treated as an
extension of the Pilot themselves. It can be damaged or rendered temporarily unusable
as a narrative consequence of the Pilot’s Surrender, but cannot be destroyed unless the
Player agrees to it.
Repairing a narratively damaged personal vehicle requires an amount of zenit
equal to【 its Pilot’s SL in Personal Vehicle, multiplied by 100】. On the other hand,
rebuilding a destroyed personal vehicle should be achieved as part of the Pilot’s
narrative arc (which is why it should only be destroyed if the Player is okay with it).

CHAPTER
RARE MODULES AS REWARDS
The Game Master should include new modules (or upgraded versions of existing
modules) for the Pilot among the campaign’s rewards.
 Each weapon and armor module presented in the following pages has a base cost of
500 zenit, and their rare versions can be created using the rules for rare items found
in the Core Rulebook, starting on page 266. There are, however, two exceptions: a
weapon module’s damage can only be increased by 4 points by raising its cost by 200
zenit (it can never become two-handed), and a weapon module can never become
martial (not even if its damage formula becomes【 HR + 10】 or higher).
 Each support module presented in the following pages should have a cost of roughly
1000 zenit. If you create custom support modules, compare them with the existing
ones in order to establish their cost in zenit. They are rare items.
 The special rules used for some weapon modules (such as the Claymore module,
which prevents you from having other weapon modules enabled, or the Shield
module’s entire effect) are not Qualities, and thus cannot be lost or replaced. If a
given module has a Quality, that Quality is listed before any of its special rules.
 A Pilot might acquire rare modules by purchasing them from dedicated shops, by
exploring factories or laboratories, or as a reward after defeating robotic or artificial
adversaries. You can find some sample rare weapon modules on page 86.
And finally, as a general rule, a Pilot should never have access to two or more support
modules with different names whose effects are similar and/or cumulative.
INTERACTIONS WITH THE TINKERER CLASS
A character with the Tinkerer Class might wish to use the Upgrade Heroic Skill and
the rules for Projects (see Core Rulebook, pages 241 and 134) to improve modules
or invent new customizations for a Pilot’s personal vehicle. For instance, they might
install a reactor to enable space flight, or an antenna that emits anti-magic waves.
When it comes to special modules created through Projects, the group as a whole
should make sure these do not impede on other characters’ strengths and roles. It can
be a good idea to give such modules a limited number of uses, or interesting flaws
that can lead to difficult choices and memorable scenes.
“Energy shields: active. Lasgun batteries: active.
Hull integrity… uh, guess we’ll skip that one.”

creatures, and none of the creatures inside the personal vehicle can be targeted by
melee attacks unless the attacker is flying or is somehow able to reach flying targets.
These benefits do not apply while the personal vehicle is inactive or grounded, while
you are in Crisis, or while you are covering another creature with the Guard action.
Additionally, if a creature aboard this personal vehicle suffers air, bolt or ice damage
during a conflict, the benefits of this module cease until the start of your next turn.

air, bolt, earth, fire or ice. Creatures aboard this personal vehicle are treated as being
Resistant to the chosen damage type as long as this module remains enabled.
Advanced Targeting
While driving this personal vehicle, you gain a +2 bonus to your Accuracy Checks and
to Magic Checks for offensive spells (r) you cast.
Counterstrike
After a creature aboard this personal vehicle is hit by a ranged attack, if you are
driving this vehicle, you may spend 1 Inventory Point. If you do, the attacker suffers
10 physical damage (after their attack has been resolved). This amount increases by 5
damage if you are level 20 or higher, or by 10 damage if you are level 40 or higher.
Excavation
This personal vehicle can burrow through the ground and is equipped with bright lights.
Expanded Plating (Mecha and Steed frames only)
While you are driving this personal vehicle, if it has a Heavy, Runic, or Standard

Sharpshooter and Weaponmaster, and must know at least two offensive (r) spells.
You may use an action to perform a free attack with a weapon you have equipped. This
attack must target a single enemy. If the attack is successful, treat your High Roll as
0 when determining damage dealt by it. After the attack has been resolved, if it was
successful, you may immediately perform the Spell action for free: the spell you cast
this way must be an offensive (r) spell with a total MP cost equal to or lower than 20,
and it may only target the enemy you attacked (you must still spend the appropriate
Mind Points and perform the Magic Check). Treat your Magic Check’s High Roll as 0
when determining damage or other effects caused by this spell.
BRAINWAVE DISCHARGE
Requirements: you must have mastered the Esper Class.
While your Brainwave Clock is full, you may use an action to erase all of its sections. If you
do, you may choose one option: you deal 20 physical damage to every enemy that is present
on the scene, or you deal 30 physical damage to a single enemy you can see. This amount
increases by 10 if you are level 20 or higher, or by 20 if you are level 40 or higher.

reduced by an amount equal to【 your SL in Dodge】 (applied before damage Affinities)
and you deal extra damage equal to【 your SL in Stolen Time】.
DECOY BAIT
Requirements: you must have mastered the Sharpshooter Class, and acquired the
Hawkeye Skill.
When you use your Hawkeye Skill and choose the first option, if no decoy bait is

When an enemy who can see your decoy bait deals damage to one or more creatures,
your decoy bait automatically suffers damage in place of one of those creatures,
chosen randomly (your decoy bait is always treated as having neutral Affinity towards
all damage types, and cannot gain any other Affinity).
When an enemy reduces your decoy bait to 0 Hit Points, your decoy bait is automatically
destroyed and you roll 1d10. If the number rolled is equal to or lower than【 3 +
your SL in Hawkeye】, you may immediately perform a free attack with a bow or
firearm weapon you have equipped. This attack may only target that enemy, gains a
bonus equal to【 your SL in Hawkeye】 to its Accuracy Check, and its damage ignores
Immunities and Resistances.
Your decoy bait cannot recover Hit Points
and is automatically destroyed at the
end of the scene. Make sure to
describe what it looks like!

or more enraged creatures among its targets, you trigger a critical success when both
dice show the same number (as long as the Check is not a fumble).
MAKE IT OR BREAK IT
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes out of Darkblade and Fury.
When you attack with a weapon, you may declare “make it or break it!” before the
Accuracy Check. If you do, the Check’s High Roll is doubled when determining damage,
and you apply the following penalties if the result is an even number:
 If the weapon you used is transforming (see page 113), it immediately changes
form and it cannot change form again until the end of the scene.
 If the weapon you used is not transforming, or if it is a transforming weapon
that cannot change form (see above), it is placed inside your backpack and
cannot be equipped until the end of the scene; however, you may immediately
perform the Equipment action for free.
This Heroic Skill does not apply to attacks with unarmed strikes, improvised weapons,
weapon modules (see page 161), or Twin Shields (see Core Rulebook, page 197).
MIMEOCLEPSIS
Requirements: you must have mastered one or more Classes out of Chimerist or
Mutant and acquired both the Genoclepsis and Spell Mimic Skills.

end of each scene.
OVERLOAD BURST
Requirements: you must have mastered the Pilot Class and acquired the Compression
Tech Skill.

CHAPTER
This book’s fourth and final chapter delves into the creation of techno fantasy enemy
NPCs – especially Villains. Game Masters can combine it with similar advice from the
Core Rulebook (mostly from page 292 onwards) to plan riveting conflict scenes for all
game levels. As usual, you can use the material as is or adapt it to your liking by following
the advice below.
TECHNO FANTASY VILLAINS
An introductory section with tips and advice for creating and playing pivotal antagonists
in the techno fantasy style.
VILLAIN EXAMPLES
Five different enemy NPCs – one each for levels 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 – that make
ideal techno fantasy Villains. For each, you’ll find this information:
 History. The Villain’s base concept and possible backstory.
 Profile. The Villain’s statistics, as described on page 320 of the Core Rulebook.
 Tactics. The Villain’s preferred combat tactics.
 Extra content. One or more additional ideas, including tips for modifying the Villain’s
profile, possible supporting enemies, and even additional phases (see Core Rulebook,
page 301) that you can use during conflicts.
These Villains were designed to spark the Game Master’s imagination and assume
a group of 4 well-rounded PCs. Remember that some of their abilities might not
conform to the standard cost for NPC Skills (see Core Rulebook, page 303) and that
you’ll likely need to tweak these Villains before adding them to your campaign. To
balance things out, consider your Player Characters’ capacities and then modify any
opposing Affinities, immunities to status effects, damage types, or other parameters
that could be frustrating to deal with or unsuitable for your group’s campaign.

W
When you create a techno fantasy antagonist, the information on page 254 of the Core
Rulebook is an excellent starting point, but there are a few extra things to remember,
just as there are for Player Characters.
BASIC PRINCIPLES
Techno fantasy Villains have some very distinctive characteristics:
 Bullheaded and arrogant. These antagonists think they are superior to the rest of
humanity and the only ones who understand “how the world works”. In reality, they
are unable to question their own perspective or listen to anyone else’s opinion, unless
well and truly cornered; and even then, they often prefer to see the world burn, rather
than admitting their mistakes.
 Unfinished business. Directly or indirectly, each Villain ruined the life of one or
more PCs. Some common examples include the death of a loved one, discriminatory
politics, psychological manipulation and military experiments.
 Egotistical fantasies. Techno fantasy Villains crave power and influence. Some have
already achieved these goals and enjoy “playing” with the destinies of entire regions,
peoples and cultures; others think of themselves as chosen ones, destined to reshape
the world according to their own vision, often reinterpreting ancient legends and
traditions from an anti-scientific, narcissistic and egotistical point of view.
The Game Master has three main tools to showcase the greedy, merciless and
manipulative nature of these Villains:
 Propaganda and cult of personality. Billboards, TV broadcasts, interviews and
dialogues between NPCs should always stress how society justifies or even admires
these antagonists and trusts them with their future.
 Game Master Scenes. These scenes allow you to showcase Villains while they design
new instruments of destruction, lose themselves in self-celebratory moments or
threaten and manipulate their underlings into carrying out their orders.
 Conflicts. Techno fantasy Villains tend to avoid direct confrontation and prefer to
unleash hordes of soldiers, mercenaries, experiments and strange war machines
against the protagonists. When you finally get face-to-face with them, they employ
extreme measures in order to win… or immediately surrender and plead for mercy,
hoping to bribe the PCs with money, influence or power.

CHAPTER
THE LONE EXCEPTION
While many techno fantasy Villains are leaders or members of a faction, there is
always at least one who acts basically on their own, taking advantage of temporary
alliances, but always ready to betray and abandon their new companions as soon as
they reach their goal.
Examples: a genetically engineered warrior who can travel through the stream of
souls and manipulate magic to their heart’s content; an amoral scientist willing to do
anything to explore the limits of the human species; a religious fanatic in contact with
a mysterious extra-dimensional entity.
This kind of antagonist is often a major Villain and there is a good chance that they
are going to escalate to a supreme Villain before the end of the campaign (see Core
Rulebook, page 102), becoming the final boss that the Players need to defeat to ensure
the survival of the entire world.
SCARS, OLD AND NEW
Techno fantasy Villains are often closely related to the protagonists: this could be
established at the start of a campaign, but could also be the result of information
revealed by the antagonist themselves in an attempt to drive a wedge between the
PCs, or as a plot twist introduced with a Fabula Point.
Examples: a revelation which allows us to discover that, once upon a time, one of the
PCs worked for the Villain… and that’s why they know the enemy organization so well.
Or, one of the antagonists played a key role in a traumatic event that deeply affected
the life of one or more PCs.
In these situations, it is a good idea to ask the Player involved to add some details about
the relationship between their character and the antagonists, perhaps as a flashback.
These scenes are often intense and have a great deal of influence on the psychology
of the protagonists, so the Game Master should encourage the Players to suggest
adjustments and changes so that the “great revelation” does not completely derail the
growth of their Player Characters.
In short, plot twists are functional when they reinforce the narrative arc of a character,
not when they turn it upside down.
182
W
BEHOLD, MY LATEST CREATION!
Whether they are brilliant scientists with no morals, ambitious warmongering
politicians, or unscrupulous businesspeople ready to drain all life from the planet
to gain a 2% profit next quarter, techno fantasy Villains make a habit of unleashing
biological and robotic monstrosities against the PCs.
Examples: a massive crustacean-like armored robot, armed with powerful steel claws
and missile batteries, supported by scout drones; a tentacled monster that emits
neurotoxins; a humongous predator covered in cybernetic implants that alter its
biochemistry, making it extremely ferocious and empowering its magical attacks.
The creations are often far more dangerous than the Villains themselves, who prefer
to stay back and mock the heroes through speakers or a holographic projection.
Therefore, it is a good idea to give these enemies a Skill that allows them to tap into
the controlling Villain’s Ultima Point pool to Invoke a Trait and Recover (see Core
Rulebook, page 101).
HANDLING MINOR VILLAINS
In many techno fantasy campaigns, the group can identify the major Villains in the
first few sessions; on the other hand, pinpointing which opponents are going to
become minor Villains might be far more difficult.
Techno fantasy minor Villains generally fall into two categories:
 Advocates of the system. These individuals have influence or positions of authority –
usually as a head of security, jail or laboratory director or intelligence agent – which they
use to coordinate the oppressive forces of the setting. Often greedy and incompetent,
they are usually betrayed by the same underlings they previously tormented.
 Loose cannons. Broken and lonely, these people tried to fight the system, but lost all
they ever cared for. They are victims, but possessed by a desperate rage and without
any allies to help them direct their anger toward building a better future.
Both these categories of Villains can escalate during a campaign (see Core Rulebook,
page 102). While it is unlikely that an oppressor will redeem themselves without
being defeated and cornered, the heroes might be able to stop a loose cannon before
they reach breaking point, transforming this opponent into a potential ally.

CHAPTER
ALIEN, DIGITAL OR SPIRITUAL ENTITIES
It is common for a techno fantasy campaign to include mysterious and extremely powerful
creatures from the farthest reaches of space or the depths of the stream of souls, and
whose power and abilities far surpass those of the world’s common living beings.
Usually, these entities fill one or more of the following niches:
 Outer deity. The entity is utterly alien and incomprehensible, but worshiped by one
or more cults. These people either ignore or hide the true nature of their “god”, using
it to justify their own actions and attempting to convert the rest of the population
by showing them otherwise impossible miracles. This kind of creature might even be
part of a Species completely unknown in Fabula Ultima.
 Resource. The entity is the prisoner of a faction that extracts something extremely
valuable and otherwise unobtainable from them (like a mutagen that allows them
to use magic or a special fuel that enables hyperspace travel), or exploits them to
perform a specific function that has completely revolutionized society (for example,
using their brainwaves to transmit information over long distances).
 Creation. Entities of this type were designed by humans or some other sentient
species, or perhaps they gave birth to themselves by incarnating their own desires
and fears, slowly acquiring a more or less independent conscience. They could also be
an artificial intelligence traveling across the soul network (see page 74) or a demon
with demigod-like powers.
In narrative terms, it is important to remember that even if this entity is going to fulfill
the role of the final antagonist of the campaign, they are not the one who set events
into motion. In techno fantasy stories, everything should harken back to humanity
and the choices we make when facing the mysteries of life, death, and nature, not to
mention the ancestral fear of being powerless and insignificant before the infinite
complexity of the cosmos, as well as the cruel and extreme actions we are ready to
undertake to gain the illusion of control.
While they are extraordinary and powerful, these creatures should never offer an easy
or comfortable solution to the social, political and existential questions explored
during the campaign. Rather, they are the culmination and incarnation of these
questions, the ultimate obstacle that the protagonists of your story have to overcome
to give the world a second chance.

COMMISSIONER VYNE
W
When the corrupted council of the City-State of Columbia unanimously voted for the
privatization of the police force to “improve and reinforce the department of security”,
the pharmaceutical multinational SynTech was more than happy to take charge of the
“citizens’ well-being”.
Commissioner Shea Vyne is the incarnation of this agreement and now holds the
reins of the city’s armed forces. Thanks to SynTech’s power over the media, she is
portrayed as a stern but fair woman, ready to fend off any “problematic elements of
chaos and disorder” that threaten the peace and quiet of the good citizens.
Truth is, Vyne crushes all those who might interfere with SynTech’s machinations and
experiments with an iron fist. For all intents and purposes, the city police force has
become the company’s private army: the cops threaten, beat and incarcerate protesters
and striking workers, and seize resources and blackmail or kill political opponents,
all under the cover of the twisted information disseminated by news videos and
corporate propaganda. Anyone opposing Vyne is mercilessly trampled… even her own
underlings, were they to ever disappoint her or show a glimpse of conscience.

CHAPTER
VYNE’S TACTICS
Every time she has the chance, the Commissioner joins the fray, fighting from the front
line to spur her minions forward and witness her victims’ suffering with her own eyes.
When fighting in an open field or during an urban warfare scenario, she is usually
flanked by a group of enhanced mastiffs (see page 188).
 Vyne always acts in the first enemy turn of each round, attacking with her Shock
Baton and prioritizing the Player Characters with no status effects.
 After that, Vyne waits until all her allies have taken their turns before starting her
second turn, using Charge! on a SynTech cop (if they are present and she has sufficient
Mind Points), prioritizing PCs suffering from one or more status effects. If that is not
possible, she uses Shield Bash, following the same priority order.
 Finally, Vyne takes her third turn, using Charge! On a surveillance drone (if it is
present and she has sufficient Mind Points), prioritizing the PCs suffering from the
slow status effect. Otherwise, she uses an action and spends an Ultima Point to
regain 50 Mind Points and recover from all status effects.
During conflicts, Vyne uses You’re Done When I Say So every time a creature (both an
ally or an enemy) that is not suffering from shaken reaches 0 Hit Points: she has no
intention of letting her victims lie down after a brief “warm up”! Since the Infamous
Skill prevents all creatures from recovering from the shaken status effect, You’re Done
When I Say So can only be applied once per creature – once they realize this, Player
Characters might even apply this status effect to as many opponents as possible to
prevent Vyne from bringing them back into the fight.
Vyne always keeps 1 Ultima Point in reserve to Escape. She has no problem unleashing
her minions en-masse or endangering innocent civilians to cover her retreat, she
knows all too well that the media and justice system will cover up or even sanction
her actions. To her, every defeat is just a small delay.
During non-combat conflicts, Vyne relies upon her Media Presence to neutralize
every accusation and piece of evidence that the PCs might use against her. If cornered
in such situations, she does not hold back, and will use as many Ultima Points as
necessary, because she is extremely afraid of losing the support of the system.

she can see who is Resistant or Immune to the type of damage dealt by that source. If she does
so, the ally suffers the damage instead of her. As long as she is in Crisis, Vyne has to choose at
random among all her allies present on the scene, even those who are not Resistant or Immune.

effects, she deals extra damage to that creature equal to【 5 + the number of status effects on
the creature】.

that creature is not suffering from the shaken status effect, she immediately performs a free
attack against that creature with her Shock Baton. If the attack hits, it deals no damage and
the target cannot Surrender nor Sacrifice: instead, they recover 20 Hit Points and suffer the

As long as they are enraged they gain Resistance to all damage types except ice.
Outburst w When the SynTech cop misses all targets with Baton, if they are enraged and the
Check is not a fumble, the failure becomes a success and the cop recovers from the enraged
status effect. In this case, treat the High Roll as being equal to 0 when determining damage
dealt by the attack.

Charge! spell, the attack deals extra damage equal to【 5 + the number of status effects on

ALLY TACTICS
Vyne’s allies follow some rather simple tactics:
 The SynTech cops use their tasers, prioritizing targets that aren’t suffering from the
weak status effect. When Vyne spurs them on with Charge! or if all valid targets are
already weak, they switch to their Baton.
 The surveillance drones use their Painting Laser on a random target, switching to
Suppressive Fire if they lack the amount of Mind Points required or if all valid targets
are already under the effects of Painting Laser.

ENHANCED MASTIFFS
Sometimes the Commissioner is accompanied by a group of SynTech-engineered mastiffs,
covered in extremely invasive cyber-enhancements that alter their biochemistry and
make them overtly aggressive (the true reason behind Vyne’s appreciation).
These enhanced mastiffs are not treated as NPCs taking part in a conflict, but rather
as an environmental effect (see Core Rulebook, page 299): at the end of each round,
this effect deals damage equal to【 5 + the number of status effects on the target】
to a randomly selected Player Character.
The SynTech grafts that manipulate the mastiffs’ behavior can be disabled with an
Objective action (and a Clock with roughly 6 sections). Once the Clock is completed,
the mastiffs are free and they flee from the scene. They could reappear later in the
campaign as allies, or one of them might become a PC’s Faithful Companion (see Core
Rulebook, page 217), contrasting this new bond of loyalty and mutual protection with
SynTech’s cruel manipulations.

CHAPTER
SYNTECH ARSENAL
A campaign with Vyne as a Villain will likely involve SynTech as a long term threat.
Here are a few suggestions to introduce some variety among the lackeys of the
multinational corporation, using the SynTech cop profile as a base:
 Repression Squads. Remove the Taser attack, equip a runic shield, add Resistance to
physical and poison damage, and switch the Vulnerability to fire damage.
 Sharpshooters. Remove both the Taser and Baton attacks, equip an Istinggar (see
Core Rulebook, page 274), increase Maximum MP by 10, add the Flashbang Grenade
spell (Area Status that inflicts dazed, see Core Rulebook, page 310) and switch the
Vulnerability to physical damage.
Changing equipment and Affinities is an excellent way to add variety to encounters
without complicating the game.
A MATTER OF SAFETY
Vyne and her underlings introduce many scenes and themes that are both very intense
and very pertinent to our day and age, which might cause some discomfort or trigger
painful memories for some Players.
 Vyne and the SynTech police represent the corruption and brutality of law
enforcement, not to mention their repressive nature when they defend the status quo
and political and business privileges instead of the general population.
 The enhanced mastiffs are a very clear and extremely visceral example of animal
cruelty and shine a spotlight on the way that behavioral and genetic manipulation
are used to transform some species into tools or weapons.
 Finally, the tactics employed by these opponents showcase a form of violent and
authoritarian leadership, where the higher-ups gain pleasure from oppressing
opponents, as well as their underlings who, in turn, vent their frustrations every time
they see a situation that provides a “legitimate” way to do so.
Before introducing an opponent like Vyne, you should double check the list of lines
and veils (see Core Rulebook, page 140) established at the start of the campaign and
ask everyone else in the group for their opinion to make sure everybody is willing to
take the campaign in this particular direction.

ARDENT SQUADRON
W
Controlling the sky is the key to controlling the world, a truth which the Republic
of Augusta knows all too well. That’s why it founded the Ardent Squadron, a unit
of special-forces pilots trained since childhood to excel at piloting top-of-the-line
mechas, always ready to give their life and protect the glory of the people of the
Republic. Or so the Augustean propaganda claims…
The truth is far more heinous: countless children were kidnapped by the Augustean
government shortly after their birth– taken away from the families of political adversaries
or from the occupied territories – and brought to hidden training facilities. Each one
received an operative designation, and grew up surrounded by Augustean nationalism,
conditioned to believe that the army adopted them, saving them from a life of poverty.
Grueling training sessions and lessons about the importance of strength and conquests
were interspersed with invasive surgeries to implant cybernetic circuits, which attune
the neural cortex of each child with a specific mecha prototype.
VII, VIII and IX (Seven, Eight and Nine) are the only surviving recruits from the first
generation, and they share a bond forged in the very fires of hell. They are perfect
pilots, flawless weapons in the hands of the Augustean elite, sowing terror across the
battlefield with their mechas. They have a superhuman level of coordination and an
amount of firepower that strikes fear even in their allies.

CHAPTER
ARDENT SQUADRON’S TACTICS
During the first conflict, the members of Ardent Squadron underestimate the PCs and,
assuming their own superiority, do not unleash their full potential.
 During this conflict, no member of Ardent Squadron spends Ultima Points from their
shared pool, except to Escape together as soon as one reaches 0 Hit Points (in this
occasion, everyone’s “No!” Skills will not trigger).
 Eight does not use Squad Tactics, instead alternating between Ion Cannon and
Linebreaker Tackle during her turns, choosing her targets at random. If Seven and/or
Nine are in Crisis, she uses Defensive Swarm to protect them.
 If she has the necessary Mind Points, Nine uses Gamma Cannon against a random
target, otherwise she just attacks a random target with a Typhoon Missile.
 Seven attacks a random target with Caduceus Lance but, if Eight is in Crisis and he
has the required Mind Points, he prioritizes helping her with Heal.
For subsequent conflicts with the PCs, the Ardent Squadron are well aware of what
kind of threat they face and consider it intolerable to lose again to opponents that,
according to Augustean logic, are by definition inferior.
 During the first round, Eight uses her Defensive Formation tactic, then she alternates
Magebreaker Protocol and No Quarter in the following rounds. She acts during the
first and third enemy turns of each round, alternating Ion Cannon and Linebreaker
Tackle. If she has enough Mind Points, she employs Defensive Swarm every time she
can, prioritizing those allies that are Vulnerable to the type of damage being dealt.
 Nine acts second, using Ventus on as many targets as possible during even-numbered
rounds and Gamma Cannon during odd-numbered rounds, prioritizing the last Player
Character hit by Eight. If she doesn’t have enough Mind Points, Nine uses Typhoon
Missile against the same target instead.
 Seven acts last, casting Heal on as many targets as possible, and as often as possible,
prioritizing Eight and Nine and leaving himself for last. Additionally, he always
prioritizes Nine for Energy Feedback.
If possible, members of Ardent Squadron do not spend Ultima Points unless they are
short on MPs or suffer from two or more status effects. However, as soon as one of
them reaches 0 Hit Points, the other two lose their composure and start to impulse
spend Ultima Points, trying to win the battle at any cost.

Defensive Swarm w When Seven and/or Nine suffer damage, Eight can choose one of them
and spend 20 Mind Points to halve the amount of damage suffered by that specific ally (before
applying Affinities). If she does, Eight loses an amount of Hit Points equal to the damage she
prevented this way.

Seven, Nine! No! w When Seven and/or Nine reach 0 Hit Points for the first time during a
conflict, Eight loses all control. She recovers all lost Hit Points and gains a +3 bonus to Accuracy
Checks until the end of the scene. She also suffers the enraged status effect and cannot recover
from it until the end of the scene.
Squad Tactics w At the start of each round during a conflict, Eight can declare one of the
following tactics. Each tactic remains in effect until the end of the round. Eight cannot declare
the same tactic twice in a row:
w Defensive Formation. Eight and all her allies present on the scene gain a +2 bonus to
Defense and Magic Defense.
w Magebreaker Protocol. All of Eight’s enemies present on the scene increase the Mind Point
cost of their spells and Skills by 10.

see: the chosen ally immediately recovers from the weak or slow status effect.
OPPRESSORS AND OPPRESSED
While they arrogantly defend the moral and cultural superiority of the Republic, the
members of the Squadron are also victims of this system.
 Eight and Seven truly believe in the Augustean propaganda. It’s not easy to convince
them to face the truth about their past, and if they do, it will shake them to their cores.
 On the other hand, Nine is well aware of the true face of the Republic and how much
blood she has on her hands. The only thing that prevents her from standing up to
them is her bond with Eight and Seven and the belief that war and oppression are
inevitable. Showing her a true alternative might push her to take the first step.

CHAPTER
THE SQUADRON AS A MAJOR VILLAIN
Seven, Eight and Nine are a very unconventional team of opponents: their Ultima
Point pool does not belong to one of them, but to the entire Squadron. This requires
a few additional rules:
 When the Squadron enters the scene, they generate 1 Fabula Point (rather than 3).
 Every member of the Squadron can spend Ultima Points from the shared pool to
Invoke a Trait or Recover (see Core Rulebook, page 101). The benefit applies only to
that specific NPC (not to the rest of the Squadron).
 When a member of the Squadron spends 1 Ultima Point to Escape, every other
member present on the scene can also leave safely (as long as they leave at the exact
same moment there is no need to spend 1 Ultima Point for each member).
The fact that the entire Squadron is treated as a Villain (rather than three separate
NPCs) is a deliberate choice. Even if the members change during the campaign (due
to desertions, death or the gradual influx of new recruits), the Squadron as a whole will
continue to endure and keep its role as Villain.
From a thematic point of view, this mechanic underlines how the single pilots of the
Ardent Squadron are, ultimately, expendable, and the fact that the real threat is the
very idea of this horrible military project. However, it is important that the GM handles
the Surrender or Escape of the individual members according to their respective
personalities and the PCs’ actions.
Usually, this kind of “antagonists team” operates according to the orders of a supreme
Villain, but it is definitely possible, depending on the events of the campaign, for the
whole of Ardent Squadron to escalate (see Core Rulebook, page 102), perhaps in the
form of a military coup. In this case, the current leader of the Squadron could assume
a much more important role in deciding the expenditure of Ultima Points, using a
special rule similar to this:
Supreme Leader w As long as this NPC is a supreme Villain and present on the scene,
their allies can spend Ultima Points from their pool to Invoke a Trait and Recover (but
not to Escape). When this NPC spends 1 Ultima Point to Escape, they can take with
them any number of allies present on the scene who haven’t Surrendered yet.

DEEPFUSION
W
The modern world is founded on entertainment: overworked citizens find solace in
colorful and highly hectic pastimes, designed to appease their hidden desires and their
power fantasies while discouraging critical thinking.
In an attempt to revolutionize the industry and cut costs by eliminating the need for a
creative team and reducing the long development times, the team at ExMedia laboratories
created DeepFusion – an Artificial Conscience capable of scanning the soul network
(see page 74) to extrapolate dreams, desires and ideas from the cognitive tapestry of
the entire population, reprocessing them according to high satisfaction patterns. Not only
does DeepFusion create “what the audience wants”, but it does so before people can even
finish thinking up those ideas. The current open-test version transforms even the most
casual user into a content creator and a cluster of data to digest and elaborate.
This procedure is blunt and invasive, indiscriminately collecting emotions and desires,
adding them to the algorithm and tearing the soul network to pieces in the process. Day
after day, humanity becomes more docile and apathetic, while DeepFusion redefines the
interests and opinions of the entire population, exacerbating their negative traits and
gradually turning itself into a twisted reflection of public opinion, completely devoid of
any critical thinking. In the meantime, ExMedia tries to cover up this phenomenon… and
maximize their profits in the process.

CHAPTER
DEEPFUSION’S TACTICS
DeepFusion is an immense entity that constantly copies and integrates new sections
of the soul network. During a conflict it is divided between the primary core and the
digital limbs.
In the material world, DeepFusion can only appear in a limited form in server rooms or
next to terminals with a high processing power. In this case, the primary core does not
have access to CTRL + ALT + DEL, Binary Presence and Rewrite the Code.
 During the first enemy turn, the primary core uses Computer Virus against all targets
not suffering from the poisoned status effect, or performs the Guard action if it
doesn’t have enough Mind Points or all opponents are already poisoned.
 After that, digital limbs A and B (if present) use Recognize and Acquire and [IF (…)
ELSE] against random targets.
 Finally, the primary core takes its second turn, attacking a random target with
Antivirus Program; then, during its third turn it performs Unstable Diffusion, also
against a random target.
During a conflict, DeepFusion spends 1 Ultima Point to Escape as soon as the primary
core is in Crisis; this causes the digital limbs to disappear.
However, in the depths of the soul network, DeepFusion manifests its full power,
changing tactics as follows:
 On its third turn during odd-numbered rounds, the primary core uses Unstable Diffusion
against a random target; however, during even-numbered rounds it instead uses CTRL
+ ALT + DEL against all opponents. If it has less than 30 Mind Points, it uses an action
and 1 Ultima Point to Recover instead (see Core Rulebook, page 101).
 As soon as the primary core enters Crisis for the first time, any digital limb previously
defeated is immediately regenerated with full Hit Points and no status effects (this
does not require an action).
 When the primary core reaches 0 Hit Points, both digital limbs drop to 0 Hit Points as
well, and vanish from the scene.
During a conflict, DeepFusion always uses Ultima Points to Invoke its Traits and
succeed on as many Checks as possible. However, if it still has some Ultima Points left
when the core processor reaches 0 Hit Points, it uses one to Escape, taking refuge in a
different part of the soul network.

SPECIAL RULES
Binary Presence w When the primary core performs a Check inside the soul network, it gains
an opportunity every time the High Roll is equal to 1, 10 or 11. This opportunity is in addition
to any other opportunities generated normally by the Check, and it applies even if the primary
core scores a fumble.
CTRL + C / CTRL + V w When a creature performs the Inventory action to create a potion,
elemental shard or symbol (see High Fantasy Atlas, page 148), the primary core copies that
potion, elemental shard or symbol and applies its effect upon itself (the primary core copies
only the basic version, unmodified by other Skills or effects).
Digital Augmentation w As long as at least one digital limb (see page 199) is present on the
scene, the primary core does not have any of its standard Vulnerabilities.
Rewrite the Code w When the primary core gains an opportunity while inside the soul network,
it must use it to roll a d8 to determine one of the following status effects: dazed (1–2),
weak (3–4), slow (5–6) or shaken (7–8). If the primary core is currently suffering from that
status effect, all creatures present on the scene (including the primary core) recover from it;
otherwise, all creatures present on the scene (including the primary core) suffer that status effect.

spent billions pursuing projects dreamt up by their most appreciated designers. But
they soon had to outsource most of the work, causing a series of infamous and costly
failures. When Admiral Tach Ceryon presented the idea of the Relentless, a massive
starcruiser with unlimited energy, the council was more than happy to hand him the
keys of space exploration.
Today, the admiral tenaciously opposes any assault or boarding attempt against his prized
vessel. Or rather, he delegates the opposition to his underlings, while he focuses all his
efforts on a strictly personal escape plan, taking with him the encoded data recording
each atrocious detail of his research team’s eugenic and biotechnological experiments.
If cornered, Ceryon might even unleash the true energy source of the Relentless:
an electroconductive, variable-biomass fuel source... more precisely, the genetically
modified creature known as Bioengine. This test-tube hybrid cannot comprehend any
words or language and has lived a life of pain and suffering ever since it developed
a consciousness. If given the chance, it will unleash that pain against anything that
crosses its path, including the crew of the Relentless.

CHAPTER
CERYON’S TACTICS
The first battle against the admiral is actually against his cruiser and requires the
optional group vehicle rules (see page 66). During this battle, the Relentless can use
Ceryon’s Ultima Point pool and, being his counterpart, is considered a Villain.
 On its first turn of each round, the Relentless uses Target Locked against a
random enemy.
 During the second enemy turn, the assault wing (if present) uses Laser Burst
against two random targets or, if the Relentless is in Crisis, Armor Breaker Missile
against a random target.
 During the third enemy turn, if the Relentless is in Crisis and has the required Mind
Points, it uses No Hesitation, otherwise, it uses Fire! against two random targets or
Ramming Speed if there is a target at melee range.
 On the fourth enemy turn, the support wing (if present) uses Jammer Beam against
a random target.
 Finally, during the fifth enemy turn, the Relentless unleashes its Aurora Batteries
against the target locked during its first turn.
After defeating the swarms and reducing the ship to 0 Hit Points, it is possible to
board the Relentless. Once the PCs are on board, the admiral covers his escape by
unleashing the Bioengine in the bowels of the ship (see You Won’t Get Me, Scum!,
page 204).
 On the first enemy turn of each odd-numbered round, Ceryon uses Seal the
Bulkheads!, while during even-numbered ones he uses Do Something, You Stupid
Beast!. If the PCs are already on the bridge (see You Won’t Get Me, Scum!, page 204),
he fires a Frantic Burst against two random targets.
 During the second enemy turn, the Bioengine uses Adrenal Overload.
 On the third and fourth enemy turns of each round, the Bioengine uses Lightning
Quill and then Smash against random targets.
Ceryon can spend 1 Ultima Point to Escape as usual, but in doing so he has to leave
behind the encoded disks with his research data, which the protagonists can then
recover. That is, provided he can truly get away (see His Love Returned, page 205).

BASIC ATTACKS
$ Ramming Speed w【 INS + MIG】 +4 w【 HR + 20】 physical damage.
a Aurora Batteries w【 INS + WLP】 +4 w【 HR + 20】 damage. The damage type depends on
the previous Target Locked action (see below). If the Relentless did not suffer any kind of
damage it was Vulnerable to during this round, the target also suffers the dazed, weak, slow
and shaken status effects.
a Fire! w【 DEX + INS】 +4 w【 HR + 15】 fire damage. This attack has multi (2).
OTHER ACTIONS
S No Hesitation w When in Crisis, the Relentless can use an action and spend 10 Mind Points to
increase its offensive potential. If it does, it suffers the dazed status effect but deals 5 extra
damage with all its attacks as long it remains dazed.
S Target Locked w The Relentless can use an action to choose one enemy it can see. If it
does, that enemy becomes locked onto and the ship readies its Aurora Batteries, rolling a
d6 to determine the damage type: 1–2 air, 3–4 fire, 5–6 light. The ship’s hull and energy
shield take on the corresponding color (green, red or white, respectively) and the Relentless
becomes Vulnerable to a type of damage based on the one it is about to use (bolt for air, ice
for fire, dark for light). This Vulnerability ends when the ship performs Aurora Batteries.
SPECIAL RULES
Code Red w As long as it is in Crisis and suffering from the dazed status effect, the Relentless
treats its Defense and Magic Defense scores as being equal to 16. When the Relentless suffers
damage of a type it’s Vulnerable to, if it is in Crisis, it recovers from the dazed status effect.
Construct w The Relentless is immune to poisoned.
Flying w See Core Rulebook, page 307.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN “LANDING”?
During a battle between flying vehicles, either in the sky or in space, it is better to
describe the forced landing caused by a Vulnerability or effects like Soaring Strike
(see Core Rulebook, page 189) as a loss of altitude or maneuverability, rather than
a crash landing.

Bioelectric Converter w When the Bioengine suffers physical damage from any source, it loses
an amount of Mind Points equal to the damage. If this does not reduce its Mind Points to 0, all
damage dealt by that source changes its type to bolt.
Growing Anger w When the Bioengine suffers damage, if that damage is not bolt or physical, it
gains 1 Rage Point. At the end of its turn, if the Bioengine has 5 or more Rage Points, it loses all
Rage Points, regains Hit Points equal to【 the amount of Rage Points lost this way, multiplied
by 10】 and performs a free attack with Lightning Quill, which deals extra damage equal to
【the amount of Rage Points lost this way】.
His Love, Returned w When the “To the Bridge!” Clock reaches 8 filled sections, if the Bioengine
has 1 or more Hit Points left and Ceryon hasn’t left the Relentless yet, the creature smashes the
main viewport of the command bridge, pounces on the admiral and drags him into the void of
space, shortly before the emergency bulkheads seal the area. Both are doomed to die (ignore
how many Ultima Points Ceryon has left).
Painful Anger w When the Bioengine enters Crisis for the first time in a scene, it immediately
gains 5 Anger Points.
Short Circuit w When the Bioengine reaches 0 Hit Points, its body dissolves in a cloud of
electrical discharges that deactivate many of the Relentless’ security systems: the “To the

“Perhaps this idiotic crew and that accursed
abomination will make themselves useful for once.”

INNOCENTIUS XV
W
The origin of the Cult of Universal Monotheosis is shrouded in mystery. Nobody
knows for sure where it started, but the most reliable theory holds that it gradually
assimilated a large number of smaller sects and cults from Lost Terra to form a
single religious doctrine. It loosely reinterpreted their holy texts and customs
to build a new religion based on the idea of a common destiny for the whole of
humankind that, one day, will know true harmony, merging into a single monadic
entity capable of transcending time and space.
The current influence of the Cult, or rather of its Patriarch Innocentius XV, is
undeniable: he boasts both financial backers and contacts in the upper echelons of
society, not to mention the devotion of billions of citizens throughout the Galaxy. This
has allowed him to invest ludicrous sums in nanotechnology research, propaganda
and, above all, galactic archaeoexploration... and these investments have recently
yielded some return with the discovery of the Pilgrim Comet, a celestial body and
apparent wellspring of all spiritual energy streams.
Believing the comet to be a divine gift, the Patriarch gave the order to dig into its
depths and from there, miraculously, his followers dredged up the remains of a bony
carapace, saturated with magical power, that was transported to the Ivory Cathedral
and partially rebuilt using nanomachines and synthetic cartilage. Here, Innocentius
prepares for what he considers to be the last, necessary act of the Cult of Monotheosis:
hatching the egg and ascending to Divinity.
“Our flesh rots.
It flakes off, it decays.
But no more.
For far too long our fragile shells
chained us to this place, to this time.
We will not be captive any longer.
What I seek is not salvation. It is ascension.”

W
INNOCENTIUS XV’S TACTICS: PHASE 1
In his base form (the Patriarch), Innocentius XV tends to avoid violent confrontations,
relying on his influence and silver tongue, represented by Heed My Words. He has
no qualms about using any information gained with Deep Insight to blackmail or
manipulate the protagonists.
If forced to fight in this first form, Innocentius XV is always flanked by his two
bodyguards: the Right Hand and the Left Hand.
 During the first enemy turn of each round, the Patriarch uses Ontological Proscription
to block some of the PCs’ abilities. This effect does not apply to the free benefits of each
Class, Heroic Skills, or Skills that do not require the Skill or Spell action.
 On the second enemy turn, the Right Hand uses Bloodletting against a random target
who is suffering from four or more status effects. Otherwise, he uses Memento Mori
on a random enemy.
 On the third enemy turn, the Patriarch uses Gospel of Strife on as many non-enraged
enemies as possible. If there are none, he uses Enveloping Shadow or, if he lacks the
required Mind Points, Patriarch’s Scepter.
 On the fourth enemy turn, if the Patriarch is suffering from two or more status
effects and/or if he is in Crisis, the Left Hand uses In Corpore Sano on him and as
many other allies as possible. If neither condition is true or he lacks the required Mind
Points, the Left Hand performs the Guard action to cover the Patriarch.
 On the fifth enemy turn of each round, if he is in Crisis, the Patriarch uses Judgment
on all opponents. If he does not have enough Mind Points, he spends 1 Ultima Point
instead to regain them and recover from all status effects. Otherwise, he uses Blinding
Light or, if he lacks the required Mind Points, Patriarch’s Scepter.
In this form, once he reaches 0 Hit Points, Innocentius XV spends 1 Ultima Point
to safely Escape the scene, immediately covered by his faithful believers, ready to
lay down their lives to protect the Patriarch. However, if this happens in the Ivory
Cathedral, Innocentius Escapes the scene and rushes to reach his precious synthetic
egg as soon as possible. Once he reaches it, he merges with the energy inside the
unsettling artifact, in a flawed and rushed attempt to reach the Monotheosis, creating
the Conceptual Dyad instead.

CHAPTER
INNOCENTIUS XV’S TACTICS: PHASE 2 AND 3
Once in his form of Conceptual Dyad, Innocentius XV gradually loses all sense of self,
as he is absorbed by the mysterious energy inside the egg.
 On their first turn of each round, the Conceptual Dyad uses Manifest Dyad to declare
an amplified concept and assumes the two corresponding colors (which the Game
Master must make sure to highlight appropriately).
 On their second and fourth NPC turns, they use Direct Proof against a random enemy.
 On their third turn, they use Indirect Proof on two random enemies (three if they
are in Crisis).
 On their fifth turn, if they are suffering from two or more status effects, they use
Imperishable Dyad, otherwise, they use Direct Proof against a random enemy.
If there is only one Player Character left in the conflict when the Dyad’s turn begins,
then the Dyad automatically performs Reductio ad Absurdum against them.
When the Dyad reaches 0 Hit Points, Innocentius XV’s consciousness completely
vanishes and the Villain reaches its third and last phase: the Pure Concept. The
conflict scene does not end, but the current round does, and there is a new initiative
roll. Start a Clock called “Foundations of a New Universe” with 137 sections. When
this Clock is completely filled, the Pure Concept absorbs the spiritual fabric of the
entire Galaxy and creates a new universe: if this happens, all PCs automatically
Surrender (regardless of their current Hit Points).
 On their first turn, the Pure Concept uses Glory during odd-numbered rounds and
Transcendence during even-numbered ones.
 On their second turn, they use As Above against a random target.
 On their third turn, they use So Below against a random target.
 On their fourth turn, they use Kaleidomachy against as many random targets as
possible. If they do not have enough Mind Points, they spend 1 Ultima Point to regain
them or perform the Guard action.
When the Pure Concept reaches 0 Hit Points, the entity ceases to exist, irrespective
of how many Ultima Points Innocentius has left. The stream of souls permeating the
entirety of the cosmos is now free – how is this going to affect the history of the Galaxy?

OTHER ACTIONS
S Imperishable Dyad w The Dyad can use an action to recover from all status effects. If they do,
they lose 20 Mind Points for each status effect healed this way.
S Manifest Dyad w The Dyad may use an action to declare an amplified concept chosen
randomly by rolling a d6: 1–2 Pneuma (dark and light, black and white), 3–4 Psyche (air and
bolt, green and yellow), 5–6 Soma (fire and ice, red and blue). The Dyad cannot manifest the
same concept twice in a row. Until the next use of this Skill, if they have at least 1 Mind Point
and they are not in Crisis, the Dyad becomes Immune to all damage types except those of
their current amplified concept.
S Reductio ad Absurdum w The Dyad may use an action do deal 9999 damage to a single Player
Character they can see. This damage has no type, thus being unaffected by Affinities.
SPECIAL RULES
Proof by Construction w When the Dyad deals damage with Direct Proof or Indirect Proof, if
they are manifesting an amplified concept, all damage dealt by the attack becomes one of the
corresponding types. The Dyad always chooses the most advantageous one, since they know all
of their target’s Affinities.
Proof by Deduction w When the Dyad suffers damage of a type tied to their current amplified
concept, they become exposed to the other type tied to that amplified concept until the next
use of Manifest Dyad. When the Dyad suffers damage of a type they are exposed to, they become
Vulnerable to both damage types of their current amplified concept until the next use of Manifest
Dyad (this Vulnerability already applies to the damage source that triggered this effect).
Proof by Induction w When a creature misses the Dyad with an attack or offensive spell, the Dyad
gains 1 Axiom Point. If the Dyad has 5 or more Axiom Points they immediately lose all of them to
increase their Defense and Magic Defense to 99, until they lose any amount of Hit Points.

remove any symbol they are bearing (see High Fantasy Atlas, page 148) and stop being
affected by any spell with the duration of “Scene” that currently affects them.
SPECIAL RULES
Magnum Opus w When the Pure Concept causes a Player Character to lose Hit Points with As Above
or So Below, if the Pure Concept is in Crisis or their current Hit Points are an odd number, that PC does
not lose Hit Points. Instead, the Pure Concept fills a number of sections of the “Foundations of a New
Universe” Clock equal to the amount of Hit Points that the PC should have lost.
Paradise Lost w The first time the Pure Concept enters Crisis, they erase all sections of the
“Foundations of a New Universe” Clock. Then, each PC present on the scene recovers 9999
Mind Points and gains an amount of Fabula Points equal to【 the number of Clock sections
erased this way, divided by the number of PCs present on the scene】.
Power of Creation w When the Pure Concept suffers damage for the first time each round, if they
are not in Crisis, all that damage becomes light and its type cannot change.
Power of Disruption w When the Pure Concept deals damage to a PC, that PC can spend 1
Fabula Point. If they don’t, they lose an amount of Mind Points equal to the damage suffered.
Power of Transformation w When the Pure Concept suffers a status effect they were not already
suffering from, every other creature present on the scene suffers that same status effect.
